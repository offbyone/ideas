Well, to all those that wished me well and good fortune with regards to my last post, I thank you, but I\'ll admit, I wish you had wished harder.

About 2:30 this morning, my dad had a heart attack.

I\'m kind of at a loss on this one. I guess first thing, it\'s not as bad as one would think. Which is still pretty fucking bad. He\'s okay, but they had to pop open a vein in his heart, put a stent in, and tomorrow they\'ll be assessing the damage.

It\'s scary, really scary. This is my *DAD*. He\'s not supposed to be, well, vulnerable\... But all those IV tubes, all that \... vulnerability. It\'s really hitting me. Time is ticking onwards, and\...

Fuck, i just don\'t know. I don\'t even know how to feel about this. I think, maybe, I\'ll just let this one sit until i know more.

Be well, all.
