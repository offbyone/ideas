It should come as no surprise to anyone that I'm going to enjoy being back at work. It's not to say that I've not been enjoying being off, either, but\...

Well, I *like* my job.

So, back to it, I guess. I've been hammering away at an [eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) plugin for the last few days \--I've made a lot of progress on some very fun code (and a whole pile of boilerplate GUI code, too, which is\... less fun). Soon, I get to the point where this editor actually *works*, and then won't I be impressed with myself.
