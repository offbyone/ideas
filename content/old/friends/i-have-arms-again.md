It's sore, it's stiff, but I have two arms, and therefore I can...

- Finish the assignment that was due last friday
- Finish the assignment that is due *this* friday.
- Do some real work on my project so as not to let down my team.
- Catch up on my paid work.

That doesn't sound like too much fun. On the other hand, I can pull up my pants easier, now :)

Somewhere in there, however, I *really* need to find some way to thank Char for the fantastic way she's helped me out throughout the first week of my slingery, when I really couldn't do much for myself. Waking up at 7:30 is *not* something she enjoys, and she did it for me.
