2002... The year of the, what, recap?

Meaning, of course, that i'm not gonna do it :)

Not a lot to comment on, here. I'm going to be pulling the site apart over the next few days, and Char (My wonderful, adoring girlfriend, who does *not* have the ability to edit my postings) will be getting a site of her own, location to be determined soon.

Other than that, school is about to start again. Tomorrow, or the next day, i am going book shopping. Fun, fun, fun. I'm really looking forward to the two new textbooks that i need, though - and... Shit! I'd best get started reading Frankenstein...
