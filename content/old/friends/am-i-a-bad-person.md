I'm posting this, slacking, from my ethics class. Frankly, regardless of the degree of interest I have in the content in itself, the presentation (didactic, lecture) is not my cup of tea. It gets good, when we start hitting the discussion aspects of the course\...

Anyway, I'm bored. Char's outta town, for those that aren't paying attention, the local hockey team is sucking it back in ways that resulted in my being mocked by the AppleCare support folk I spoke to this morning, and work was\... if not completely useless today, competitive with it.

Blah.

If the weather gets good, at least I can go skydiving this weekend, having been unable to last week (sorry to disappoint, Dad -- I was at the library getting books for the Phil250 paper that was due, well, today).

We'll see.
