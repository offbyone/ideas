Having arrived easterly now in grand ole Winnipeg, I now settle into the serious business of relaxing for a few days.

Had a lovely dinner last night w/ Char's mom and her husband at a nifty little hole in the wall chinese food restaurant.

The rest of the trip is, however, a bit more up in the air, since Char's plans have been somewhat messed up by\... We'll call them "factors beyond our control," and leave it at that. Hopefully the wind dies down a bit and we get some sun, or Char's gonna be crushed. No beach time!
