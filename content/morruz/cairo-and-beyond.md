So, we saw some more older pyramids near Cairo and then on we go. At 9:00 yesterday morning we went through the tunnel at Suez City under the Suez canal and entered Asia. We then drove down the east side of the gulf of Suez about half way heading inland about 15 minutes south of Abu Rudies to Mt. Sinai, staying in a neatish hostel and doing the ascent. 1250m up to 2285m to the top. The old man made it and am pleased with myself, didn't even slow the others down.

It wasn't as severe as how someone punishes me but it was a climb for sure. This morning we looked over the monastary there and then drove to Dahab, about half way down the west coast of the gulf of Aqaba and are checked into a neat resort for the next two nights with no tours planned, just wander around, look at things. This is a resort town for wealthy Egyptians. Oh, I'm drying off from a dip in an arm of the Indian Ocean.  
An incident that happened, do NOT try to take pictures of the police here!!! We have been quite safe, I have not felt at risk and have been well off the beaten track a few times. There is a large police presence, mostly with an armed police about every block in touristy areas but around banks and we went through about six check points across the Sinai peninsula, bedouin country. This country does try to make it safe for tourists and locals.  
Oh, I can see Sudia Arabia across the gulf from our pool. It is sunny and about 30 something although yesterday was cool.  
For all off you, this trip set up for me is working very well and is well worth the assistance of Trekescapes/Gecko. It is more packaged than some trips I've taken but lots has been included, quite an experience so far.
