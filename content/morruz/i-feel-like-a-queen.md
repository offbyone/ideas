The Onsen that Jamie took us to was an unbelievably amazing experience, especially after the odyssey that was the luggage returning experience. I think I am now a wanted criminal, I had to sign some type of confession about my ignorance of Japanese law....Uhhh?

Anyway. Some things you may be completely jealous of:

Hot springs at the side of a lake at the top of a volcano.  
Naked swimming while it is SNOWING. Ummmmmmmm.  
HEATED TOILET SEATS.  
Feather beds  
Amazing robes. you have no idea how good clean cotton feels on freshly hot-springed skin. It is also so humid here, combined with the minerals in the hot spring, that my skin is soooo soft and smooth.  
Pillows that feel like they are made out of pearls (this was less luxurious, but mostly because they really can only be slept on while supine)

I'd just like to correct Chris' previous post, we can use the ATM, it is the conversion rate that is confusing. We both tried to take out 10,000 yen in stead of 100,000 yen. (that is 100\$ in stead of 1000) Atms are in English, so they are really not that hard to figure out. But they are VERY hard to find. And only open during regular business hours.

I also had some Pocari Sweat. Japanese National drink. Much like Gatorade.

Jamie tells me that Hobos make cardboard houses that they take their shoes off before entering. I guess you can't teach old dogs new tricks.

I'll shut up now and let you look at some pictures.
