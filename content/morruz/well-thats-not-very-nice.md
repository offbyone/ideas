So, we made it to the island! So far, we've walked around, snorkled a bit off the beach, and ate. We've got a pretty sweet little set up here, Right beside the church (I'm not even melting! I think it's presbyterian, that might have something to do with it) so we always know what time it is :) and a couple markets, a laundrymat, many many restaurants and shops, and of course the beach. Also, it's like 10 steps from the port, which makes carrying baggage quite easy. The NGV (Navir grande vitesse) is unbelievable! It is so fast, and amazingly smooth (I coule barely tell we were moving, even while I was peeing) and it only takes 2h55min to travel the 180km.

I have to say, I'm not sure if it had anything to do with my mood, or what, but I wasn't really all that impressed with Nice. It seemed touristy, with little to offer other than bars and beaches. Cab fare was incroyable! 14 Euros for 800m. that's like 20 bucks! could you imagine? Anyway, I'm left with the feeling that we missed out on something, cause everyone was so enthused about it.

So far the food here is really good, understandably, and the local animals are primarily goats and boars, so my beach towel is one that has the head of an goat superimposed on the map of corsica. It's delightfully kitch. The cheese and the beer here are amazing, I don't even know how to describe the cheese, but it's really good :)

More stories will follow, I'm sure. This place is really laid back, and nice. A good change :)
