Well, I just got handed a new\... well, \_newer\_, system. It\'s equivalent to Char\'s laptop, which is more than 5 times faster than the old system.

It\'s nice. And I can take it home, if I want to. Which is pretty cool, if you ask me.

So I\'m pretty happy \-- I have a real system to work on again. Yay me!
