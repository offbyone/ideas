As seen [here](http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1110150624459&call_pageid=970599119419), it appears that our illustrious, and apparently irremovable leaders have decided that trivialities like private communication are no longer required for the day-to-day perpetuation of our government.

So.

Let's see\... an ISP will (if this passes) have to provide detailed information about any subscriber to the police, \_without a warrant\_? What the hell?

Words fail me, not least due to the degree that I'm tired. But I hope that you can see the way I do on this one \-- this is just flat-out wrong.
