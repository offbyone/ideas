Everything is complete. All we have to do is show up, and drink wine.

One of my coworkers asked me yesterday what I am going to be doing in Corsica. And, well, Nothing really. Tanning my naughty bits, excercising my thighs (bikes and mountains, people. Get your mind(s) out of the gutter!) eating seafood, drinking wine. I suppose if there are sights to see, we'll see them. If there aren't, then we'll snorkle, cliff dive, boat. Speak french to the locals. Read bad corsican poetry. Maybe even good Corsican Poetry.

But most importantly, Love Chris, Of Corse

:)
