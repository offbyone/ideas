Really great experience hiking to Torres del Paine, a much photographed mountain and well worth the tortous hike up. Four hours ending in a 1 hour scaling of moraine (rock field) at a severe slopel. I did make it. I paid for it over the next two days as my legs were sore. We did a couple more hikes but Morris will show the pictures as rain cut me off one day and sore legs the other, I did try though. Basically, our first day was gorgeous, a touch of sunburn, the next was on and off rain and the third was wind, and I mean wind.  
Quite a parque, the Torres del Paine (read pain for me). The refugios we stayed at were really nice and there were lots of pleasant people. Great scenery. This was an expensive bit of holiday as the rooms (shared accommodations), meals and drinks were priced at remote resort type prices but we survivied. Anybody who likes to rough it camping would find this a paradise. Lots of travellers from variousw places, switzerland, england, australia, israel, germany, france, some americans, spain, italy.  
Now we are off to the tip, we sail this afternoon and will be crossing the staits of Magellan going to Puerto Williams. If anybody can´t find these locations, check with Simon as he has my map of Argentina/Chile.  
Next message from the tip, moi
