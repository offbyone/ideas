I just wanted to mention how much I want to go to Romania. This morning I was wasting time on the internet, and you know how surfing works, you end up somewhere random. Sure you can pick the path, and sometimes it makes sense, and sometimes it is bizzare. I ended up here

Now, don't get me wrong, I don't have some romantic idea of gypsies and poverty and tht kind of thing, I just got thinking of Simon and My trip, and talking to Ilana, and wanting to go there and why.

The dilema is this:

skiing and snow clad castles, or lakes/mountains and sun drenched castles?
