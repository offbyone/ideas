This city does *not* stop.

Seriously.

There was heavy-ish traffic as I took a cab to the hostel at 4:00 AM, for pete\`s sake.

So far: Shinjuku, which is the club district, and is ... busy.

Shibuya, which is excellent and karaoke-ey.

Akihabura: nerd mecca, and where I snagged pornographic figurines for Beau :)

Anyhoo, internet time is almost up, so I am off.
