It looks like there's going to be some serious work starting on one of my projects, the vcard editor. A few of my classmates and i are planning on starting work on it over reading week, and if i can get a semi-robust parser working for it, it's possible that we'll have something that could pretend to be usable as soon as April.

Of course, the parser thing is a big stumbling block \-- it requires learning things that i've never had to deal with before, so i'm looking forward to dealing with it as it goes.

Yeah, i know this sort of thing is dull to most of you\... But i like it.
