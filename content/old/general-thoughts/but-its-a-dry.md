(Cue the sound of someone from the coast being strangled)

Welp, it's bloody hot. 8th floor, no surprise here \-- I'm actually shocked it's not hotter. However, it does make me look forward to going back to work. Air-conditioning and a fun job are conspiring to make me love work even more than I did. It's actually a relief, sitting down at my admittedly-underpowered devel laptop and banging out a mixture of C and Tcl code for fun and profit. Which reminds me, I really need to get the finishing touches on to \[Cronometer\](<http://cronometer.sourceforge.net/>), whose development has kind of\... stilled. Sorry about that, \[Aaron\](<http://www.spaz.ca/>).

Well, in other news, we're getting the last bits of the settling in done, here. I just spent the morning packing away all the crap sitting in my office, storing what must be stored, and shelving what\... Well, you get the idea. It's a nice room, now that it has space. We'll be putting in a sofa bed when we have the cash, but things are still a bit tight. Once we do, we expect to host extramunicipal guests at C&C's as often as possible. Other than the assholes with loud motorcycles, it's a nice, quiet place\... which reminds me, I need to check with \[EPS\](<http://www.police.edmonton.ab.ca/>) about noise ordnances, and maybe doing some evening enforcement around the street below.

Hope all of you are doing well. As Mir mentioned, I've been a bit slack on the postings lately. I'll try to remedy that.

Oh, and the upcoming, not-yet-released \[Family Guy movie\](<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385690/>) is effin' hilarious.
