And we're in.

It's a pretty flash place.

So, thanks to a great many friends \-- of whom only two have a web presence, and therefore get a [web](http://vernondalhart.livejournal.com/) [shoutouts](http://www.offby1.net/mildillson) \-- the move went off as close as can be to the ideal "without a hitch" experience.

I would like to formally thank:

| Simon
| Brady
| Mel
| Vicki
| Dad
| Beau
| Jerry
| The D&D Conglomerate
| Ryan

To the rest of you, thanks for the many offers, some of which had to be turned down due to logistics. Nonetheless, you are welcome in our home any time :)

We hope to have things squared away by the time I get back from Brazil yet again, and after that we'll talk housewarming.
