![cat_twins.jpg](http://www.offlineblog.com/images/clonedcat.jpg){.image .image width="220px" height="168px"} Bearing out something i\'ve been harping on for ages with respect to the cloning debate is this [news article on CNN](http://www.usatoday.com/news/science/2003-01-21-cloned-cats_x.htm). Essentially, it consists of a description of the first cloned housecat, CC, who is nothing at all like her genetic forebear Rainbow. Amazingly enough, much like identical twins, *who share the same DNA* exactly like clones do, the cats\' environments heavily influenced what sort of personality and physique and even fur coat they ended up with.

On a related note, as mentioned in the article, isn\'t the business name [\"Genetic Savings and Clone\"](http://www.savingsandclone.com/) hilarious? ;)
