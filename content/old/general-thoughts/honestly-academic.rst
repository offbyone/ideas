There comes a time, i think, in everyone's experience where one has to
make a choice between confilicting ethical judgements. For example, try
this one on:

It's come to my attention, by various means, that there are people in
one of my classes this year who've decided that they don't really need
to follow the "one person, one assignment" rule that typically defines
*solo* projects. But no.

Instead, these kids have decided that the project we've been given is
too hard for only one person, and have determined that the only way to
do it is to work in teams.

Pah.

So... I know that these people are cheating. And i know that i'm
offended by it. what do i do now? I'm more than a bit inclined to bring
this to the attention of the prof...

And there's the conflict. I've learned through years of abuse that
ratting out on people doesn't get you anywhere, and is in itself an
ethical position. But ... I can't really argue much in favour of this,
since it's, well, not a very good ethical position.

Hm.

I think perhaps making this one clear and open to the prof might be the
best course after all...
