I had a peculiarly disappointing day yesterday. Not the whole day, but a part of it really shook my faith in the ability of people to grow in a positive direction.

I took a bit of time to look up one of my old classmates, call him D for the sake of anonymity. D was one of the people that i attended school with from the beginning through to grad, and I remember always having a fair amount of respect for his native intelligence. We were never great friends, but he wasn\'t one of my principal tormentors either.

Now, D has a pretty good life \-- he\'s getting married, owns a business \-- which I was happy to see. However, he also believes that the world is young, it was made some excessively short time ago at the behest of a supernatural entity, carbon dating is a sham, evolution is wrong (note, \_not\_ \"Natural Selection is wrong\" \-- I got told that natural selection works fine, evolution doesn\'t) and, well, you get the idea.

I hate to lose respect for someone like that. But all of the residual respect that I once had is gone now, and I\'m left with a feeling of profound disappointment.
