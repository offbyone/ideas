Damn computers\...

Well, not really. But the machines DO piss me off sometimes. For instance, take my firewall - the wonderful piece of machinery that lets my computers talk to the world outside my walls, and allows the three of you that read this site to get in and peek into my personal life. It croaked. Or, rather, *part* of it croaked yesterday. It's thanks to the good graces of my dear brother that i have anything operating at the moment, and i am deeply grateful for it. Hopefully, there will be no such failures in the next while.

How was yer holidays, folks?
