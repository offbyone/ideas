\"\`Why Religion Doesn\'t Matter \<http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/11/18/05434/162\>\`\_\_\", an article at [kuro5hin.org](http://kuro5hin.org/) is pretty much guaranteed to piss off the religious sorts amongst my readers. That being said, i think it bears a read, even if the idea makes you wanna hit somebody\... There\'s not much more i could say that hasn\'t already been said in there, but i thought i\'d toss this one off anyway - k5 has always been one of the best sites on the net for this sort of thing, and i\'m always glad to pass more views off their way. For the tech-inclined amongst you, think of it as the \"thinking man\'s [slashdot](http://slashdot.org/)\", a place where reason, though it doesn\'t rule, per se, it *does* dominate.

Go forth, and pontificate!

| Now, on the religion subject\... /me ducks.
| If i see interest in it, i\'ll pursue some of the better links on the subject i\'ve found. It can be a fascinating subject, no matter which side of the debate you find yourself on.
