Probably not as tired as Char, but at least I ate today. I'll leave the details of the day to her, but suffice to say I'm enjoying it. The language is coming a *bit* more naturally to me, although it's pretty clear I'm an Anglo here.

INSERT_MAP

Tomorrow it's off to Rheims, which is bubbly country.

Beers tried so far: Abbey de Leffe (Blonde, belgian, and sweet) and Ch'ti (French, light and crisp). I'm trying to remember these as best I can, because I know I'll be quizzed on them when I get home.

Hope the cats are doing well.
