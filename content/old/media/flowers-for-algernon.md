At the suggestion of my subconsious, and in response to a recently-unburied memory of having read the story - prodded by Simon\'s .sig and some other input, i just finished (and started) reading *Flowers for Algernon*. Whoah. What a heartbreaking book. I remember the story pretty well, but i don\'t remember it having that kind of an impact on me when i last read it - either the story didn\'t pack the same \'punch\', or perhaps it was that i wasn\'t mature enough at the time to really appreciate the horror of what happened to Charlie. Either way, it was pretty harsh. I think that pretty much anyone who can empathize with another human - and i\'m not usually the type, as most people know - will feel hard pressed not to tear up at the end of that novel.

Given that i\'m already in a harsh mood, maybe yesterday wasn\'t the best day to pick the book up :)

At any rate, i did. Read it beginning to end in about two hours - pretty much non-stop, with a small break to go swimming (Which is going well, thank you). For those of you who aren\'t familiar with the story, well, i don\'t want to give it away. Suffice to say that it\'s very sad, and it\'s very good. It\'ll make you think. I know it\'s making me think - even re-evaluate the way i look at retarded people. I don\'t know if it\'ll have any permanent effect on my thinking on the subject, but i do feel that i have a slightly different outlook. It\'s hard to read the last fourteen or so pages of *Flowers* and not come away feeling like you\'ve been shown a dirty side of yourself.

Here\'s something that interested me, though. I read this today, and coincidentally, there was a [discussion](http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/12/02/0324226&mode=thread&tid=99) on Slashdot about \"What makes great Science Fiction?\". And, when i checked it out, there was over 1000 postings, and not one mention of this story. I\'m peripherally aware that not many people think of it as a Science Fiction story - there\'s no lasers, no aliens - at least not visible ones - and little or no high technology. But it did shock me that the folks over at /. didn\'t even bring it up once - and usually there\'s always at least one art-wanker who insists on proving that his definitions of a term are so much more advanced that he \*has\* to bring up an obscure, seldom-recognized title. Nope. Not even one.

I was dismayed.

But, no matter. At least the novel got read- which, if it had been clothed in the trappings of \"real\" scifi, it might not have. And that\'d have been a shame.
