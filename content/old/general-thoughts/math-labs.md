Why on earth would there be such a thing as a math lab? I\'m not, as you all know, averse to the use of technological tools, but this is a pure-ass waste of my time. I\'m sitting here watching our lab prof go over things that we covered in class, what, two weeks ago, just so that we can enter the problems into a software package and see pretty graphs\...

Bah.

Now i *know* that i\'m getting old - i don\'t see the point to this damned technology\...

Scary?

Yep.
