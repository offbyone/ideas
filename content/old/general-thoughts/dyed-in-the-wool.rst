Despite the fact that I am, as the title suggests, a dyed-in-the-wool
conservative in a great may respects, I like to think that I'm not
particularly reactionary in most respects. That being said, there is an
interesting conservative reaction I have regarding a few modern
conveniences.

The first one is cell phones. As discussed `on the waiter
rant <http://waiterrant.net/?p=328>`__ a few days ago, and spotted via
MetaFilter (where else?) people have a bizarre love-hate relationship
with cell phones, and more generally with their users. On the one hand,
it's leading to a change in social norms, as people start having
conversations that could, at best, be viewed as debatably appropriate
for public consumption in subways, busses, restaurants, and other
places.

The rant linked above, however, is interesting because in a lot of
respects the person writing it is, from his other postings, a
liberal-leaning individual who is having the classical conservative
reaction to the new and different -- he's decrying it as destroying
social institutions as though they have inherent value, as opposed to
simply existing as a consequence of previous upheavals due to changing
technologies and mores. I, on the other hand, tend to take things like
the cell phone in stride. Sure, the definition of what is polite
changes, but that's been happening throughout the course of human
history, from the vomitoriums at Roman binges to the straitlaced,
repressive Victorian ear (in public, at least) to today, with our cell
phones and our email.

So, in this respect, I fail the test of conservatism.

The second issue, the one that's been ticking about my head for the
longest, is the issue of the automatic transmission. I freely admit, I'm
a stick in the mud on this one. It's weird, because on one hand I'm in
favour of letting machines do the work that machines are good enough at.
I support automation, and the obsolescence of the manual labourer. I
come down in favour of machine intelligences being developed to remove
the likelihood, and reduce the probability of human error in complex
tasks.

But, despite all of that, I cannot get over my strong preference for
manual transmissions, and a subtle, but definitely present, sense of
elitism when I realize that I am in a shrinking segment of the
population that is comfortable with controlling more aspects of their
vehicles. This is classical reactionary conservatism, decrying a change
that is, at least by objective measures, beneficial to society on the
basis that it is... different.

At this point, I imagine that readers are thinking: "Is he going
anywhere with this?"

No.
