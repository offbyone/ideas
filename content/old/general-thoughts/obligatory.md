The Christmas season is past, now begins the age of \_Boxing Week\_.

Scary thought, this, although Char is going out today with my mother to brave the hells that are malls and big-box stores in order to\... You know what, i\'m not even sure \_what\_ they\'re after.

At any rate, that\'s their lookout. Here\'s the rundown on the week so far:

Monday, we gorged ourselves on the rarest, bloodiest tenderloin steaks i\'ve ever had. I could cut the blinkin\' things with the \_dull\_ side of the knife. That, and they were so rare they might as well have been sushi. Good stuff :)

Tuesday was gorgery, pool, beer, and hanging out with a rarely-seen good friend. And Guiness.

Wednesday \-- Christmas eve, for the date-impaired \-- was spent with again, more pool, some shopping, some cleaning, some cooking, and a 4.5-lb prime rib roast that was devoured in its entirety by 5 people. As though it was never there. Then, hm\... I honestly don\'t recall what we did next. I think it might have been something like \"Drank some wine and fell asleep.\"

Christmas day dawns, and we get to the swag. Gifts all around, although some highlights were: Char \_and\_ Mom buying Char and I a digital camera. Char getting the [complete Far Side collection](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740721135/schoolblog-20?creative=125577&camp=2321&link_code=as1) from Dad. General gorgery on all our parts :)

Boxing day\... Well, i\'m not doing much of anything today, except getting the digital camera set up and figuring out how to post photos to the blog :)
