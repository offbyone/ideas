Char and i have now arrived in Victoria, and are getting settled
preparatory to the wedding on saturday. Plans seem, fortunately, to be
more or less set already, which is good, because that means that i have
very little work to put in to the party. Yay!

Char made an interesting comment on the ferry across to the island, she
said that between leaving Edmonton and returning on Monday, we will have
traveled by train, plane, car, bus, boat, foot, and possibly bicycle
throughout the trip.

The train trip was nifty. Granted, it was dark when the part that i
would really have loved to have seen passed us by, but i did get to see
the rocky mountains pass us by as the sun set behind the heavy clouds.
It was very pretty, and a perspective on the mountains that i do not
usually get on them - the road was often on the other side of the
Thompson river from us, and that's where i would usually have seen it
from.

Now, to see the man wed. This is gonna be great!
