It seems that ownership of a building `no longer
allows <http://wsj.emailthis.clickability.com/et/emailThis?clickMap=viewThis&etMailToID=35733465>`__
a person to determine how the property is used. If even one element is
"offensive" to a tenant, well, it *must* be removed - now! (via `the
Misanthropic Bitch's news
filter <http://www.misanthropic-bitch.com/>`__)

The story linked above is a Wall Street Journal story about a pair of
abstract nudes that adorn the ground floor of the 77 Water Street
offices of Saloman and Goldman Sachs in New York. The piece is part of
an elevator vestibule there. The word from the companies is that their
female employees have complained about the existence of the nudes.

The first part of this that bothers me is the complaint. For christ's
sake, there's (repeat after me) *nothing wrong with the naked human
form*. Nothing. Why is it that people have to be threatened by any
depiction of something that, for ~50% of the population in any given
instance, is a depiction of themselves? Are we, as a culture, so
self-conscious that we can't stand to look at ourselves any more? I
know, i know.. this isn't a new issue. But it is a frustrating one. I'm
not trying to suggest that we have billboards with hardcore pornography
beside the highway. While that wouldn't bother me personally, i can see
that it would be a little over the top. But a tasteful - and, from the
article, nearly unnoticeable - nude in a *privately - owned* building
isn't on that level. So, at risk of offending the occasional radical
feminist who feels that all pr0n is evil and exploitative, i just wish
this issue would wither up and die...

The other thing that really burns me is that the owners are being fought
over their right to control the building that they own - the lease they
have with the managers of the building explicitly states that the ground
floor cannot be modified without their permission, and yet the work has
been taken down three times. Now, they're being sued. What right does a
*renter* have to dictate what happens in a part of the building that
they're not even renting? The piece isn't in the companies' offices.
It's on the ground floor. It's seen for all of a couple of minutes while
waiting for the elevators. And it's **not their property**. The brothers
who **own the building** want that art there. What right do the tenants
have to go against their wishes?

I've commented on this before, though. Everyone seems to think that they
have a "right" not to be offended. By anything. Anywhere. Any time. I
wonder what sort of `morally stunted
culture <http://plif.andkon.com/archive/wc161.gif>`__ we'll have if
everything that is offensive or tasteless, or simply unacceptable to
some action group or other, is removed from the public space? Last time
i checked, the pursuit of happiness - not the actual happiness itself -
was a fundamental right. And implied in that is that we won't always
have it.

Oh.

Merry Christmas, too :)
