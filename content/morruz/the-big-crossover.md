Hej all.  Well, Dad and I are now in Puerto Montt, after spending three great days on the Island of Chiloé.  This island is one of the most scenic places we've been yet.  On one of our day trips on the island, we went to visit the National Park of Chiloé, and on the road there we hit the most southerly point we will make on this trip, roughly 42.5 degrees.  There was a great soft white sand beach there, looking out on the vastness of the Pacific ocean.  Other than that, there was some nice trails through interesting forrest, with many trees that I don't think I've seen before.  I've really come to realize that, while the deserts we saw in the north of this contient last year were awesome, the true beauty of this country in my eyes is the lush greeness of this central portion.  You just feel like you're breathing fresh clean air, with all the plant life photosynthesizing constantly around you.  Add to that a crisp breeze off the ocean, and it's heaven.  It's so easy to see it all here in Chile.  As a Canadian, I like to say we come from a country of extremes: hot, cold, glacial, rich farmland, rolling prairies, towering mountains, coastal rainforests,....etc, etc, but given all that, I've seen the same such extremes here in this small narrow land.  From the driest place on earth in the north with the Atacama desert, to the fjords and mountainous glacial wastelands of the south (which we can see the start of from here in Puerto Montt, but unfortunately won't be travelling through on this trip).  The lush green farmland of central Chile is a narrow strip between the spine of the Andes and a breezy coast with a healthy fish and seafood trade.  It's neat to see and sometimes hard to wrap one's head around.  Just the order that we've been doing things in, we've been bouncing back and forth between inland destinations and beaches and ports, all in less than the distance of the drive from Edmonton to GP.  I'll always recommend Canada to travellers as a place of great natural beauty, but from what I've seen so far of Chile it could be equivalent, in it's own way.  The big difference here would be that there is really nowhere that you can say that you are very far from anyone else, as Chile has half our population in less than a tenth of our landmass.

This is mostly all coming clear in my mind now because tomorrow Dad and I make the big crossover to Argentina, as we hop on a bus to Bariloche, which means that we are saying goodbye to this amazing country for now, only to return in a couple of weeks to make the journey home from Santiago.  Another small adventure in a trip full of small adventures.

I guess that's all for now.

Ciao!
