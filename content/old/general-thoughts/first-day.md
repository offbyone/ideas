... and butterflies like fscking _elephants_.

The assignments look really damned hard.

The classes seem to be covering enough ground to swallow the Red Army.

I don't know where to go, what to do, anything. At least, not until tomorrow.

Stress is _fun_!

I know that this is all in my head, but _damn_ am I intimidated by the year ahead of me. GMC was never this hard to get into, and I never felt like I'd be this out of place. Not to mention the strain of job hunting, taking courses that are above my level...

I can do this, I know I can do this, but christ it's freaky at first....
