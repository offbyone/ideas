\[Char\](<http://xraystar.livejournal.com>), \[Matt\](<http://www.offlineblog.com/mildillson/>), \[Amy\](<http://lashingtail.blogspot.com/>), and I just finished moving the contents of a seemingly-pared down life over four hours of hellish heat and cramped quarters.

I've found an open wireless relay that, at least, works from the balcony of the suite, which means that, while netless, I'm not boned.

I'm hot, and tired.

Air-conditioned movie theatre, here I come!
