But I think I forgot to eat today. Sure, I had breakfast, but that was like 10 hours ago. I'm feeling pretty queezy right now, and I think that's why...

Oh well. So Chris and I did, in fact visit the catacombs, and they were every bit as cool as an ossuary should be and a bit cooler to boot. I liked the winding damp tunnels and all the dark French poetry about death. Some were really touching, some were religious, some were just nihilistic. Not nearly as informative as the Sewer museum, but that could be just because we were self guided. Speaking of which, I was proud of myself yesterday for totally following the tour in French. I was worried in the beginning, since I had no idea what she was getting on about, but I soon realised I just needed a bit to get used to the "accent". We've been making a concerted effort to read all in french, listen and speak (to others) and I think to good effect. We've only run into one Surley french man, and many many awesome ones. I even wrote in French in my "diary" this afternoon.

Chris and I just got back from the Mussee D'Eroticisme, and it was OK. The feature exhibit was a Japanese one, which chris and I both agree, is not our kind of thing. I've never been able to find anything erotic about Japanese Porn, or whatever, They've lost the sensual and gone straight into the extremism of sexuality. There were some neet things to see, and some very well executed pieces. We stood beside the Moulin Rouge, not nearly as grandiose as I'd expected, and Chris had his life threatened on the subway.

I'm all over the place in this entry, mostly because I just can't focus on anything other than that I want some fine french food. On that note, I will end with a highlight:

Last night, Chris and I went out for dinner, it was good, yes, but I racked my brains for about 35 mintues trying to find a desert I'd enjoyed more that the one that I was served, and I came up short. *"Figues Roti"* was all it was. Roast Figs, Fig puree, and creme anglais or vanilla creme fraiche, I'm not sure. It was so intensely flavorful and perfect. I don't know if there was any added sugar at all. Wow. It knocked my socks off. Miam Miam :)
