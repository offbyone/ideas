I just took the time -- thanks to the wonders of this Interweb thingie -- to watch the official theatrical trailer for Star Wars episode III.

It looks _good_.

_Really_ good.

My inner geek -- You know, the one that dominates pretty much everything I do? -- is just about creaming his jeans. First, this one is rated PG-13 (or so I hear) and second, it looks like they actually may have wrung some acting out of the young Mr. Christensen.

I'm not going to rant about it here, anyway. I have, however, decided to see it.
