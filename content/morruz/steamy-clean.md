Jamie took us to an Onsen yesterday, from which we have just returned (wait for Char to upload pictures, later today). Think of Radium-style hot springs, with tatami rooms (rice mat floors) and a very quiet, pleasant atmosphere.

So, we soaked and enjoyed the light, mountain snowfall on us as we did, and then we sipped Asahi beer and slept. Not necessarily in that order, mind. Food was an experience... or an experi*ment*, depending; I could identify damn near nothing of it, which meant that I was alternately pleased and disturbed by what I ate. I also discovered that I am not, generally, a fan of Sake.

The roads here are just amazing; think the Fraser canyon highway, but narrow and switchbacks. It climbed epically quickly, going from dry and mostly green to white within minutes.
