Churning through my CS labs, as usual. I think i'm annoying the prof, but that's okay. At least in the labs my questions are relevant, which is more than i can say about the lecture sessions\... Since i don't actually know java, i have to ask stuff that, if it were in Delphi, i would already know. What's really "entertaining" is the game we're building\... Oooh, Checkers!

You know, for the life of me, i can't remember ever having played Checkers. This game is pointless. We should have built Go or something.

All told, though, it's fun. I like playing guru in the class, since that's pretty much my status. I am, after all, a ninja at this shit, and i'm also egotistical enough to *really* enjoy showing that off. Childish? Yeah. Fun? Hell, yeah!
