Although the offenses in question have more or less confined themselves to entries farther down the homepage, I've been getting spammed a few times a week, on *my own website*! However, it seems that i'm not the only one, and a few other people are mad as hell [and don't intend to take it anymore](http://kalsey.com/2003/11/comment_spam_manifesto/).

It seems that, through some strange agency, my site now actually has enough incoming links to qualify it as a search engine ratings booster. Kind of a backhanded compliment from spammers, i guess.

See, the thing is, at this stage, i'm getting probably \~10-15 pcs of spam per day. This is just in my private mail account, forget the amount of crap i see throughout the rest of my browsing. At this point, the only thing keeping my inbox usable - in the face of not only said spam, but also high-volume mailing lists - is the fact that i now handle my own mail server. I can't imagine how useless e-mail is to people without this benefit. How do you handle it?
