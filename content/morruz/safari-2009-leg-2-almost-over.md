Well folks, its 7 in the morning in Arusha, Tanzania, I'm up and have had tea. Both Kenya and Tanzania are 10 hrs off home. Tomorrow we go to Nairobi and then off on leg 3 of thisw excursion.<wpg2>6175</wpg2>  
Christopher, we did not actually see the cheetah do the killing but I have pictures of her and her 2 cuubs eating, they were abouty 15m from the truck. nWe've had lions rub against our vehicles. The other morning, 5:45, walking to the toilet an elephant walked out the other side of the building no more than 15m from me. <wpg2>6145</wpg2> Hey, that early and the dark tree area starts moving and has tusks you think you are still sleeping. Due to light I didn't get an exceptioinal photo but do have one. For this portion I experienced so much that I just cant remember it all to tell you. <wpg2>6136</wpg2> By going thru photos it'll all come back though. My apoplogies ahead of time, I have lots of photos.<wpg2>6148</wpg2>  
Again, this is a camping trip. I would recommend it for anyone who leans that way. If you'd rather just do the Serengeti/ngorongoro there are quite the flyt in lodges there. Quite the variety of landscapes. People are friendly, here in Tanznia they speak a bit less english and that is accented. Kids wave at the truck all the time. Sellers here are back to the aggressive type like Egypt.  
Hot showers last night!!!!  
I guess that's it as I just can't remember all I want to say, this has been a 2 week experience that I'll never forget. luv, moi<wpg2>6133</wpg2>
