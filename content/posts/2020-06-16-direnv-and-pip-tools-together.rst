:summary: A relatively simple way to automate locking your pip-tools requirements using direnv

I have been experimenting with using `pip-tools`_ to manage my python project dependencies. If you're not familiar with it, I encourage you to read Hynek Schlawack's excellent `introduction to dependency management in Python <https://hynek.me/articles/python-app-deps-2018/>`_ which introduces it and offers some comparisons to other alternatives like Poetry and Pipenv.

The simple explanation, though, is that pip-tools offers two commands: ``pip-compile`` and ``pip-sync`` that work to keep a virtualenv's dependencies both reproducible and in sync with the expressed requirements. This is done by having the developer edit a ``requirements.in`` file, which is compiled into ``requirements.txt``, and then synced into the project virtualenv.

At the same time as I've been on this kick, I've also been trying out `direnv`_, which I am *very* late to the party on. Direnv is a tool for managing per-directory (or directory tree) environment variables, evaluating a bash script in a limited interpreter to set custom environment variables in fish, zsh, or bash shells. One of its highlights is its useful stdlib, including a great python + virtualenv integration:

.. code-block:: bash

   layout python python3.9

This simple command creates a virtualenv using Python 3.9 in the project
directory, and automatically activates and deactivates it as you enter/exit. Afterwards, you can install ``pip-tools`` in that virtualenv the old fashioned way:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install pip-tools
   ... some output here
   Successfully installed pip-20.1.1 pip-tools-5.2.1

Now, if I wanted to add a dependency, I would simply insert it into my ``requirements.in`` file:

.. code-block:: ini

   click

And pip-compile/sync:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip-compile requirements.in
   ... prints out the contents of requirements.txt, and writes it
   click==7.1.2              # via -r requirements.in
   $ pip-sync requirements.txt
   ... some output
   Successfully installed click-7.1.2

This is pretty easy... but what if you could skip all of these manual steps? Direnv has a way: custom hooks in ``~/.config/direnv/direnvrc`` that you can reference in your ``.envrc`` files. Here's how I manage my pip-compile automation:

.. code-block:: bash

   function use_pip-tools() {
       requirements_file=${1:?"a requirements file must be provided as the first argument"}
       shift
       local has_pip=0
       if has pip; then
           if [[ $(which pip) = $PWD/* ]]; then
               has_pip=1
           fi
       fi
       if [ $has_pip -eq 0 ]; then
           echo "[use pip-tools] No pip installed via layout; try layout pyenv or layout python"
           return 1
       fi

       if ! test -f $requirements_file; then
           echo "[use pip-tools] No requirements file $requirements_file"
           return 1
       fi

       if ! has pip-compile; then
           echo "[use pip-tools] pip-tools missing; installing"
           pip install pip-tools
       fi

       requirements_txt=$(echo "$requirements_file" | cut -f 1 -d '.').txt
       if [ $requirements_file -nt $requirements_txt ]; then
           echo "[use pip-tools] resyncing requirements"
           pip-compile "$@" $requirements_file
           pip-sync $requirements_txt
       fi

       watch_file $requirements_file
   }

And then, I just have to enable this in my ``.envrc``:

.. code-block:: bash

   layout python python3.9
   use pip-tools requirements.in

Now, when I change my requirements file, I get automatic pip-compilation:

.. code-block:: console

   $ echo requests >> requirements.in
   direnv: loading ~/tmp/direnv-piptools/.envrc
   direnv: using pip-tools requirements.in
   [use pip-tools] resyncing requirements
   ...
   requests==2.23.0          # via -r requirements.in
   ...
   Successfully installed certifi-2020.4.5.2 chardet-3.0.4 idna-2.9 requests-2.23.0 urllib3-1.25.9
   direnv: export +VIRTUAL_ENV ~PATH

And voila! Every time you update your ``requirements.in`` your virtualenv will resync automatically. Also, any time your ``requirements.in`` file is newer than the compiled one, it'll re-run this too.
