...are all I can share with you. How do I describe being safe harboured, delayed, in a small cove just south of the straits of Magellan to ride out a gale for a whole day. Winds gusting at some unbelievable rate, mingling with the fellow passengers. By the way, this was on a ferry, a very small ocean going ferry. Describe the swells off the pacific coming over the boat as we turned to the Beagle Channel. Yiou should all see the glaciers along this channel. That was really an addition to my life.  
We´ve been in Puerto Williams where Morris got snowed out on her hike. Ate more centolla, crab.  
Again, people are constantly providing a vast panorama of life. Juwie & her dad Kval were really nice to visit with, the austrians, lots of other tourists from all over, all friendly. The helpful locals everhwhere.  
We are now in Ushuaia and have made our first tentative feel for a trip to the south, more later.  
Take care all, moi
