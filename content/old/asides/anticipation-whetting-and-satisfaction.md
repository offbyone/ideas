A: Looking forward to a good game of hockey tonight, good hamburgers, and good company.

W: Found a nifty site called [Luxist](http://www.luxist.com/) that blogs the *things* of the rich and famous. I smack my lips in consumerist glee at some of them, and shake my head in vague discomfort at others.

S: Against all odds, my iPod works again!

If you could see me, I couldn't claim to be dancing a merry jig. Since you can't, I am.
