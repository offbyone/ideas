Well, two. If you count speaking ones. About ten, if programming languages figure into it.

Which reminds me \-- I\'m up from 44.78% to 50.68% on the \[Geek test\](<http://www.innergeek.us/>). (Featured here on \[30 May, 2003\](<http://www.offlineblog.com/backlog/2003/05/30/test-yourselves/>)) All of you should take it, let me know where you sit now.

Lots of school work to get done. Not to mention (this weekend, at least) helping Ali move, \[Char\](<http://xraystar.livejournal.com>)\'s book club, and just getting to \_see\_ the lovely lady, which happens too rarely lately, what with work and all that school stuff I do.

It\'ll be nice to see \[Matt\](<http://www.offlineblog.com/mildillson/>) & \[Amy\](<http://lashingtail.blogspot.com/>), though \-- It\'s been nearly a month.
