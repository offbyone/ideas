I'm looking at the front matter of one of my professors' \[weblog\](<http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~wcooper/graymatter/index.html>), which closely associates \[Che Guevara\]([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara)) with the \[Free Culture\](<http://www.freeculture.org/>) movement.

Does anyone else see anything ironic in that? Rabid communist/socialist as an icon of Free Culture?

Faugh.
