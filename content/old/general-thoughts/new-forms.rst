I just stumbled on an interesting `essay on
cheating <http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/InDefenseOfCheating.html>`__ by the
author of the `Design of Everyday
Things <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/dt/assoc/tg/aa/xml/assoc/-/0465067107/qid%3D1073925345/schoolblog-20/002-2782151-0670423>`__,
Don Norman.

Essentialy it's a (valid) argument that grading would work better if it
weren't there at all, and instead peoples' schoolwork would be better
categorized by their abilities - be they "Leader", "Scholar", "Seeker of
information" etc...

Anyway, you get the idea.

So, how would this work? Does anyone have any other ideas about this?
How about any teachers reading this...

Okay, odds are slim, but still :)
