Well, the [lady](http://www.livejournal.com/users/xraystar) and I are off to Mexico for a week of sunning, eating, drinking, and the making of merry.

Blogging will be minimal, obviously, although I'll still be slaving away at [homework](http://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~c340/labs/labAssign2/) while I am away. Cheer for me!
