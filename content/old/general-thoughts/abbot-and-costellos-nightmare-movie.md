Along with Mir, [Simon](http://www.livejournal.com/users/vernondalhart/), Andrew, and [Char](http://www.livejournal.com/users/xraystar/) (of course) I just watched The Day After Tomorrow, a Jerry Bruckheimer-esque vision of the future of the world, courtesy of Global Warming (insert echoey fright effect here)

As one would imagine, it's a fair amount of schmaltz, and the story itself mainly focuses on plucky americans rescuing plucky americans from (plucky) american cities in nasty bad bad situations.

Leaving aside the horrible dialog and the wasted effort that they called a plot, I was left (for the last hour of the movie, since there was nothing better to do) thinking about how neat it would be to see more detailed exploration of the results of a climatic cataclysm of this nature. Many fantasy novels I've read over the year are set in a world that only thinly conceals its distant past as our present. The theme of medieval cultures rising from an apocalypse in the present day is one that is fairly common, and truly fascinating to me.

Throughout the genres, there have been roleplaying games such as [Rifts](http://www.palladiumbooks.com/), [Tribe 8](http://www.dp9.com/Worlds/T8.htm) and many more whose names escape me now. There have been novels, from the Dark Tower series to the arguable references to our present in the Wheel of Time. There have been movies\...

And it's that last, of course, that spurred this line of thought. A line which, I might add, is going absolutely nowhere.

I wish I could communicate the mix of emotions that seeing icons of civilization brought to ruin through nature's hand or man's makes me feel. The stories that touch me most, the science fiction whose dark and gloomy side so frustrates me, are the ones that tell the stories _after_ the fall of man.

I guess I just watch movies like the Day After Tomorrow and I think that mostly I just want to see what happens after. Not the nice clean save, or the evacuation. I want to see and read about the fall.

Morbid?
