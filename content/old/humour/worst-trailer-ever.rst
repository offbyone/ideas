Alright, it's not Nimoy doing [Bilbo
Baggins](/backlog/2002/11/26/hobbits/), but this
[trailer](http://www.boll-kg.de/neues/aitd\_trailer\_large.htm) is by
far the most amazingly shitty bit of cinema I've seen since I made the
mistake of renting \_The Phantom\_. Although I strongly recommend that
anyone with eyes and a brain give the movie itself a miss, the trailer
really does have to be seen to be believed. (extensively [mocked
here](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/34901))

### Update

It seems that the link to the movie is no longer working. Trust me,
you're better off that way. If you still really need to see something
bad, just follow the "Bilbo" link. You'll do just fine.
