Well, given that there were only two interviews for
[IIP](http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/iip) positions located in Edmonton, at
least as far as those in Edmonton, I'm pleased to say that I was either
number 1 and number 2 in the rankings for the positions.

The one for which I was #1 was here on campus, and it was interesting,
but not as interesting as the one I will be taking with ACI Worldwide,
starting in May. I hope that I'll be able to handle the work, but in the
end I'm pretty sure I can.

So, that's set. All worries aside, I do have my job set for the 16
months following my third year.
