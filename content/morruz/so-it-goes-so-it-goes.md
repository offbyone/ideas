We're sitting in Frankfurt, having just arrived via plane, train and automobile. A late night and an early start later, we're almost prepared to head back home. Or to sleep. One or the other.

Two more nights of opera later (with a semi-professional guide for good measure) culminating in a fantastic performance of Carmen, the above quoted late night and early morning...

It has been a blast though. The latter part of the trip (beginning around Brno or Krakow) has been by far the most memorable, and I could easily see myself wanting to skip my merry way back here. You know, rent a flat in Žilina (or surrounding area) to stow gear at, and then just spend week or half-week long trips hiking through the mountains of Moravia. I could stand that. Anyone else up for it in a few years?
