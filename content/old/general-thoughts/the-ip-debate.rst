Yesterday, in Calculus I class no less, i got into an unexpected debate
about the Israel/Palestine situation. One of my classmates is,
apparently, quite interested in the situation, and felt the need to hold
forth on the subject... So, naturally, I rose to the occasion (since, as
most of you know, i *love* a rousing debate. It was fun, but something
about it rubbed me a bit wrong.

Is it me, or is it a bad sign when the person you're arguing with refers
to all Arabs as terrorists, or animals who should be exterminated?

I don't think it's me.

Anyway, it pretty much occurred to me that there really wasn't a lot to
debate there - it was analogous to trying to convince me of the validity
of a "god-fearing" world-view. Not too likely, i'm afraid...

But... Damn, it's fine to finally get into a real debate - even if it
was a fairly poor one.

That is all.
