So, i guess i wasn't all that clear - the easy lab yesterday was the
Chem 101 last lab - i expect that the lab exam in Chem will be quite a
bit harder than the CMPT 114 lab final that i just finished. <brag>Damn,
was it easy! :) </brag>

So, one course down - more or less. Wish that the lecture section of
CMPT was a lecture-lab arrangement. Is it just me, or is trying to teach
programming without computers kind of foolish?
