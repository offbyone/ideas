I think the conspiracy yesterday was to make me actually \_feel\_ old,
by working me over body and mind, so that today I wake up tired, with a
sore back and stiff limbs.

I love you all ;)

Squash is responsible for a sore forearm and back, biking for sore legs,
and disc golf for a sore shoulder. My mind is awash with details I never
knew about good friends and family, which is great -- I'm going to get
Char to forward me the emails that she assembled into the fantastic
party game that we played, and I intend to read over them all.

Thank you all so very much, those of you who were able to come out last
night. I had a great time, and it was arguably the best birthday
e-var!1!!bang
