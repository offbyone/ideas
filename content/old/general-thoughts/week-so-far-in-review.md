Well, it's been a hell of a week so far. Let's see what the tally is at:

One(1) busted clutch master cylinder. \$232 later\...

One(1) buggered up foot. It's been hurting for two weeks. Shitty, that.

One(1) ripped, nice, driving glove.

One(1) ratched knee from moving a treadmill.

Trade anyone? ;)

Other than that, though, life's been pretty good\...
