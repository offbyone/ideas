Oh, if only more of you used Macs :)

Well, it really doesn\'t matter, of course. However, there\'s a neat app called [Tangerine](http://www.potionfactory.com/blog/2006/10/18/introducing-tangerine/) that tickles my music-lovin\' soul. It scans iTunes for songs with similar beat patterns and groups them into playlists so that you get automagical mood-based playlists.

It\'s tough to say how much mileage I\'ll get out of this; I have an extensive and complex set of automatic playlists that may or may not be eclipsed by this. Still, it\'s got promise.

And, they claim they\'ll give me a free license for shilling for them. How can that *possibly* be bad? :)
