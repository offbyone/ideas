I just had my attention brought to the EFF(Electronic Freedoms Foundation)'s [User's Guide to EULA(End-User License Agreement)s](http://www.eff.org/wp/eula.php), which is a nice, human-(read: non-lawyer)-readable introduction to the wooly wonders of licensing for software.

Trust me, read one of those some time. They're bloody creepy, and they're getting worse, not better.
