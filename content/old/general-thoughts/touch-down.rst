Aternately:  A touch down.

Not really, I guess, but it's interesting decompressing and realizing
how much stuff I need to get done.  I freely admit, I'm procrastinating
something fierce right now, trying to avoid actually workingon anything
productive.  Bah.  How ... normal.

Anyway, EclipseCon was great.  I hope I'll be able to make it again next
year, although I doubt it, since next year I'll be schooling full-time,
and I don't expect I'll be in the same position to ask for favours from
work.  Still, one never knows.
