So, what's new?

Wow... where to start...

Okay, so first up: We sold the house! Char and Matthew went up to
Edmonton over the last week, and handled the final sale of our house to,
well, honestly I have no idea! Some folks from out east, anyway. It cost
us more than I wanted, but less that I was braced for. So, that's ...
okay. It means that we're out from under the threat of mortgage + rent
payments, and leaves us in a good position to truly *live* in Seattle.

Second up: Char and I went out for our first night on the town last
night; we left Matthew with a babysitter and took off with a co-worker
of mine and his newly-MD-bearing fianc√©e to have some Thai food (Thanks,
Jeannie, Ian, Johanna, and Colin!) and some beers in a very hip bar in
Capital Hill (a neighbourhood west of downtown Seattle). A good time was
had by all, or so I assume. A good time was had by us, anyway ;)

Next Friday we are having all of our possessions dumped unceremoniously
in our new home. I've written a bit about it but maybe it's easier if I
provide some locational context:

*lost to the sands of time*

It's a lovely place; smaller than we're coming from, but we've learned
to purge already, and I can't see any reason for us to stop doing so now
that we've moved. The big concession -- and I hate to do it -- is that
I'll probably do a book purge. Some Seattle second-hand bookstores are
going to get a bolus of nerdy literature in the near future, I think.
I'll probably filter for books that I can replace digitally.

A later post may talk about work. Or maybe not.
