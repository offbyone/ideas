This is starting to be a March theme, I think. I get swamped, I get a bit behind, and now all of a sudden, despite my best intentions, I am staring at deadlines I might not meet, with workloads I can barely handle.

Only one month to go. Perhaps I'll get to see a couple of episodes of Die Nasty this year, yet.
