We are moving around in Argentina after some quality time in Bariloce.  Christopher, it´s not so much european in flavour as just a bit more uptown in atitude, not problematical though.  Argentina, so far, is cleaner, more our style of buildings and cleaner.  But then, I found southern Chile to be quite a step in that direction from all of Peru and Bolivia.  Of note is that Argentina is supposed to be probably the wealthiest country down here but in Bariloche the cars in use are a lot older and more of junk heaps than anywhere in southern Chile, I think their mechanic died over a year ago and no one has accepted the position yet.  Muflers, tuneups, seat belts and signal lights are definetely an option not many people invest in.  Gas in Chile was about \$1.30 yet here is close to \$0.75.

Word is you are having a great warm winter, congratulations all, moi
