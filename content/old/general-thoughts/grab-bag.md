I am obliged, upon actually tasting it in a quiet setting, to reverse my long-held distaste for Big Rock Traditional Ale. It is, in fact, quite tasty.

Also, [this](http://techcentralstation.com/042304C.html) essay on academia and truth may be of interest to A) anyone who teaches amongst my readership (all of one person, as far as i know) and B) anyone that learns (Many, many more)

In other news, I finished my last exam today. I need 92% on it to get 90% in the course. Here\'s hoping! My other grades seem to be in the A-to A range so far, but Pscyh, and Algorithms haven\'t made any splash at all yet. We\'ll see.

In case you skipped it, seriously: Read [this](http://techcentralstation.com/042304C.html). I\'m not kidding.
