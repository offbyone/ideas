As of today, sometime around noon, I finally got to bid Telus fare-thee-well from my finances forever. Or, so I hope.

Vonage is the carrier of our phone service from here on out, which means that, well, we're early adopters. So I appreciate any and all consideration of the limitations of our current service when you get calls from us that have glitches and fuzziness. But on the whole, I expect it to be good.

W00t!
