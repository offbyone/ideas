is an interesting comment on a problem I've observed in CS, as well.
Basically, although I'll concede that my sympathy is... limited (is
\_anyone\_ surprised by that?) on the subject, this author makes a good
point. The people who make it into the teaching positions in the hard
sciences are often not sociable people. I can think of one professor I
had last year that acted as though he saw every conversational request
for help as a prelude to me trying to make off with his lunch money. And
he's not the worst in the school.

Fixes? Who knows... Maybe more teachers like [Moebius
Stripper](http://www.talldarkandmysterious.ca/) are needed, or maybe
somebody needs to look at these professors' skills and, if they cannot
teach, \_teach them to\_.
