A few things coming up soon;

| - One, there\'s a ski trip happening in a few days, on the 22nd, with much of my family that will be very fun (good idea, \[Char\](<http://xraystar.livejournal.com>)!).
| - Two, Christmas. I\'m short on gift ideas, so suggestions \-- to the extent that I\'m getting gifts outside the family \-- are welcome. A particularly good suggestion might net you some swag, anyway. And yes, dear, I \_know\_ what you want ;)
| - Three, school is done for the year tomorrow morning.
| - Four, we\'re about ready to release version 4.0.0 of our \[flagship product\](<http://www.planetct.com/home.html>)

It\'s a busy, \_busy\_ week.
