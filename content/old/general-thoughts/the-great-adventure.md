begins today.

Well, yesterday.

Okay, actually, the first time I did it with the laptop. No, not \_that\_ it, the \_other\_ it.

Heh.

What I\'m trying, scatteredly, to convey is that as of today I\'ve bid Windows farewell. Barring a need to install it for games (which MAY happen) at some time in the future, it\'s history. I am using a nice, clean install of a linux, now, and I like it.

Of course, it has issues, not least of which is the 3D support. Which doesn\'t really exist, at least as far as I can see. However, that might change. I\'m sure you\'re all fascinated by it, so I\'ll keep you all posted.
