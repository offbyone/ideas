It's a small thing, to some, and i forgot to even post on it, but i finished my last exam two days ago. Semester three of eight is finished, and i'm still cruising along.

Also, yesterday, i received the first scholarship of my university years. It wasn't anything really big, but never complain about an extra thousand dollars :)
