As the post title (and categorization) suggest, I started work today.

I think I'm going to like this job. I'm not saying it'll be perfect, but
this is going to be an interesting experience.

So far, however, it's been... dull. I have a workstation that was
actually just coming into high-end when I graduated from high school,
and a desk that affords me less privacy than, well, my new location at
home.

Still, the people are pleasant and intelligent, and the work won't be
dull -- once I have a machine that can do it.
