Holy. shit. what. a. rush.

When i woke up this morning, i could barely move out of bed. Lifting
myself - against the burden of gravity - seemed to be too much effort to
contemplate. Simon called at about 7, 4 hrs after i went to sleep,
letting Dad and i know that he had made it, and less than 20 minutes
later, we were off.

Off where, you ask?

Well, about 30 min west of Edmonton, there's a place called `Eden
North <http://www.edennorth.com/>`__. Wonderful place, as the name
suggests, and i am more than a bit pleased with the day i spent there -
tired, or no.

What did i do there, you ask?

Um... I broke Chris' first law, that's what. "Gravity Sucks."

Now revised.

Moving the rest of those laws up the line, i have now purged the old law
number 1 from the books. How can i say that gravity is my enemy, when i
just heaved myself into its jaws and fell a kilometer from a plane to
the ground below. What can i really say about it?

There is nothing, nothing at all, quite like looking up at the wing,
hearing "go!" and opening my hands and watching the plane move
forward... and *up* away from me. Seconds later, feeling the jerk as the
nylon deploys above me, and i look down through a kilometer of empty air
to the ground below.

What a rush. What else can i say?
