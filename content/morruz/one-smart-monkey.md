Cajmin and I were getting very silly last night. We started spelling our names Čheskie style. I´m Šár. He's Cajmin. I don't think it's the same in Slovak, but hey, what can you do.

Today C. and I are going to hike out to the abandoned castle that is outside of Źilina in Strečna. It's about a 14 min bus ride, then a 3 hour walk or something like that.

This is what I saw last night  
<wpg2id>2466</wpg2id>  
This is what it really looks like  
<wpg2id>2463</wpg2id>  
This is a bizarre outdoor chrch, the mountains are heavily forested, so it´s not much to look at in pictures  
<wpg2id>2394</wpg2id>  
And this is that awsome band  
<wpg2id>2418</wpg2id>
