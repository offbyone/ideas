I'm in a particularly bad mood, this evening. As a consequence of some poor planning, on my part and that of others, I'm at loose ends for the evening, every plan I had -- in sequence -- having become obsolete in some fashion or other.

This is primarily due to work, today and yesterday. This isn't a condemnation of my job, by any means; that's still excellent. Rather, I blame [WebSphere](http://www-306.ibm.com/software/websphere/). More specifically, I blame certain [extension methods for its security](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tsec_devextsec.html) infrastructure that are rendering me insensible.

Ah well. Such is life.

On the more amusing site of the software world, someone who is as geeky as me (and as interested in software design methodologies) should read the conference site for [Waterfall 2006](http://www.waterfall2006.com/). This is some seriously good stuff. Trust me.
