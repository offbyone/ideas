As of 10:11 AM Eastern Time, [SpaceShipOne is airborne](http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/SS1_airborne_040621.html) as the first non-governmental space shot.

May this bring in an era of private and public flight to the stars for the average joe.

To me, at least, this is probably one of the best news events of the last year or more. One small step for [Man](http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/SS1_pilot_040620.html)\...

# Update

As of this writing, the SpaceShipOne \[has landed\](<http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5261571/>) safely. Next stop, re-use and re-launch.

It\'s a big one, folks. This is a big, big event.
