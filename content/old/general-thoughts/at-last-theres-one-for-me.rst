Over at `Introvertster <http://www.airbag.ca/introvertster/>`__, i've
found the social network site for people like me. At last, a group of
like-minded individuals who have chosen to \_avoid\_ each other :)

Hey, you know, given the spew of networks that cater to the excessively
social -- "Friendster":http://www.friendster.com ,
"Orkut":http://www.orkut.com/ , and
"Livejournal":http://www.livejournal.com/ , to name a few -- it's nice
to see one that caters to people who hate chain letters, quizzes, "what
kind of $(FOO) are you?" and all the sundry bullshit that characterizes
those communities.

Wow. That was crotchety :)

Anyway, all told, i'm in a pretty decent mood at the moment. Thanks to
the local health care facilities, my dad is alive, well (more or less)
and on his way home for recuperative purposes as we speak. He'll be
okay, and that's really most of what matters. I hope that this is the
warning that it should be and that...

Well, i hope that he outlives me. But i know that won't happen, so i'll
settle for just living a large number of healthy, dirty-minded,
fun-having years.

Love you, Dad. Take care of yourself!
