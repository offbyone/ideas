For those of you that weren't actually *at* the drop zone yesterday, I
just completed all of my requirements for solo CSPA certification, which
means that I can jump solo anywhere in Canada.

Three good skydives, yesterday.

I'm a happy man. So were Ryan and Fraser and Julian, all of whom had fun
first jumps.

All told, a good time was had by all.
