Amazingly enough, despite the fact that he talks like he's got a mouthful of marbles, Sylvester Stallone makes an excellent interviewee... by email, at least.

Ain't it Cool News has a _long_ series consisting of fans asking Sly questions, and some of the answers are just comedy gold, and _not_ because I'm laughing at him, because I'm laughing _with_ him, at the questioners.

You'll have to check out the whole set, but here's a sample answer:

>\> Please reconsider writing your autobiography! If not, would you consider writing a sequel
>\> to 'Sly Moves' which would focus primarily on mental health & attitude instead of physical
>\> health? I'm picturing a Stallone version of 'The Power of Positive Thinking' - what do you think?

> Thank you very much. Iâ€™m flattered that you think Iâ€™m a candidate for stable mental health.
> But the truth be known, I am insane with long, horrible fits of sanity. Now, if you can make
> insanity work for you, thatâ€™s actually called creativity. If you canâ€™t, thatâ€™s called a menace to
> society. Thank you.
