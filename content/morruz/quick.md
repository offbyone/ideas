Just to let you know, we are on the Atlantic coast, Peurto Madryn as of this morning.  Another sunny, going to be hot day.  We travelled overnight so didn\`t see any farming so no comment yet.  The area surrounding here is almost all sand with gorse so quite desolate.  No pointy things with white tops anywhere to be seen.
