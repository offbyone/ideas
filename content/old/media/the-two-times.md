I've now seen The Two Towers twice. Last night, instead of the relatively intimate "intimate" family only showing, we wandered out to South Ed. Commons and saw the movie en-masse. I'll freely concede, it was pretty impressive the second time. A lot of the things that jarred the first time through worked a lot better than they did the first time.

| I think it's because i had had time to consider the reasons why some of the changes Jackson made to the plot may have been necessary. For the most part, the alterations are cosmetic - changing only the appearance rather than the intent of the work. There was only really one glaring problem that i had with the movie, which can be **(spoiler warning!)** found in the extended portion of this post.

| On the whole, i was impressed. I look forward to seeing this with a few of my better friends over the next couple of weeks whilst it rules the top-grossing lists. The gripe i have? Faramir. I don't see any reason at all that Faramir had to behave more like Boromir than not. Faramir was always supposed to be the wisest of Denethor's children, and i wish that they had left that in place.

But that's just my opinion.
