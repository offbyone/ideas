Well, to all those that wished me well and good fortune with regards to my last post, I thank you, but I'll admit, I wish you had wished harder.

About 2:30 this morning, my dad had a heart attack.

I'm kind of at a loss on this one. I guess first thing, it's not as bad as one would think. Which is still pretty fucking bad. He's okay, but they had to pop open a vein in his heart, put a stent in, and tomorrow they'll be assessing the damage.

It's scary, really scary. This is my *DAD*. He's not supposed to be, well, vulnerable... But all those IV tubes, all that ... vulnerability. It's really hitting me. Time is ticking onwards, and...

Fuck, i just don't know. I don't even know how to feel about this. I think, maybe, I'll just let this one sit until i know more.

Be well, all.
