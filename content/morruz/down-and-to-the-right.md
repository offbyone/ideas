So my bag, trailing behind us, has got an almost biblical knowledge of the streets of Brno before we finally arrive at our suite for the duration of our stay here. As for myself, I've been surviving on a pretty steady regimen of beer, espresso and fried cheese. My life will be shorter by the time this trip is over, but richer all the same.

Also, the two Canadian ladies we sort of toured around last night were quite pleasant. I think we ended up showing them a side of Praha that they wouldn't have seen othewise--beer, opera, large portions of meat and all.
