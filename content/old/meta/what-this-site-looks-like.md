God DAMN, differing CSS implementations piss me off. To those of you using a standards-compliant browser (ie: not IE), this site should look *pretty* decent. Not great, but there shouldn't be any glaring foulups. I hope. For the rest of you, in the majority who use IE to view websites, i'm working on it. Please, bear with me. And, if you think you can help me (as in, you have much more experience with CSS that i do -that's not hard) please, drop me a line.
