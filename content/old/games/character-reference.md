I am about to start playing D&D again as a player for the first time in years. Well, not D&D specifically, so much as Pathfinder. It\'s a bit jarring \-- having run a 4E campaign for a while \-- going back to the Vancian magic system that characterized D&D all the way through to third edition.

On my plate for this campaign are two things; one is to develop a character that I can play and enjoy, and two \-- this is much geekier \--to determine the changeset between D&D3.5E and Pathfinder; there have to be some differences, but I\'m not sure what they are.

I can do the character part without research or expending much in the way of energy (at least initially) so I\'m going to do that here, first.

I picture a fortyish man; he\'s used to having his own way, and has a history in local politics. I\'m thinking he was perhaps the mayor \-- or fantasy equivalent \-- of a small village, a fairly peaceful one. He\'s not a strongman, he\'s an academic, and a bit distant but well-organized.

He would have been ousted. Not willingly. Possibly over a scandal. Maybe a real one, maybe one manufactured to drive him out. In any case, he\'s not welcome back home. He is adventuring because he can\'t stay home and he needs to find a new place to settle down.
