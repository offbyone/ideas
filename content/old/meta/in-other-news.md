There\'s been a small change to the weblog, which I assume you have noticed.

New software, new toys. Should be easier for me to work with, but I do ask that you users please accept the small glitches (and generally bland look) that will accompany any new site design until I get it all straigtened out.

On that note, please feel free, if you\'re a CSS ninja, to help me with it \-- i\'ll supply the template and the CSS to anyone who thinks that they could turn this into something like my old site, sans tables, with all the neat stuff i used to have.

Thanks again.
