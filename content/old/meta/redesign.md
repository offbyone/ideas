You may have noticed something different. I hope so, at any rate.

I'm looking for ideas for the top of this thing -- What's a good plan for the header? It's kind of plain right now, I'm thinking images of some kind, and maybe some colour changes, but I believe I'll be sticking with this overall for the layout. It's really nice and really extensible. I heartily approve. Hope that you readers do, too, but really... It's good enough ;)
