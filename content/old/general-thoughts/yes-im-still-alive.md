It\'s just that i haven\'t had anything to say.

The whole Columbia thing is still a bit depressing. I\'ve been roaming about in a bit of a fog, which isn\'t a good thing, given that i have a midterm on Friday. A fairly hard one, as well.

The general feeling i\'m getting from this newest shuttle disaster is one of apathy and indifference, which makes me quite sad. I wish that people around me were more aware of the importance of exploration and extending our reach beyond our grasp. That is, after all, what makes us special.

Oh well.

In other news, midterms are coming up, so soon i\'ll be actually stressing.. Woohoo! :)

All you readers out there\... Are any of you still commenting? :) Reading? Posting?\...?
