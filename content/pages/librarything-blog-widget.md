There's not a lot to show, here. This widget will show you a selection of books from LibraryThing in the sidebar of your WordPress weblog.

Get it here:
[widget-librarything.php](http://svn.wp-plugins.org/widget-librarything/tags/latest/widget-librarything.php)

There's a sample of it over to the right. I'd document it more, but at this time I'm just too lazy.
