Why I stand with the SJW crowd, even though they get it wrong sometimes.

Disclaimer: I have always had a bit of reflexive distaste for the SJW
movement. Complaint as performance irritates me, and there is a thread
-- maybe a real one, maybe one I perceive -- of that running through
much of the SJW movement on the social media where the very most
recent SJW movement took its roots. I have even fairly recently been
more inclined to laugh at the antics of /r/tumblrinaction or to nod
along in vague agreement with parts of the MRA manifestos, or to
observe the circular firing squad of the left line up more violently
against its nearest allies instead of focusing on what I thought were
common enemies.

I can't do that any more.

Those movements are toxic at their core, and I *thank* GamerGate for
showing me the full breadth and scope of it. If people who claim to
have the same motivations as I do are turning them into these assaults
on women in gaming, then perhaps I need to reexamine the principles
that led them there. I am not a misogynist at heart, although I'd be
willing to bet I've said misogynist things before.

And maybe even the performance aspect is worth revisiting. Is it
performance art when a drowning person flails their arms for
attention?

Last night I watched another game developer driven from her home by
explicit threats of violence. I saw a prominent gaming magazine give a
platform to one of the originators of the GamerGate hashtag, one who
openly participated in attempts to drive Zoe Quinn out of her home and
to suicide. Another interviewee wrote articles in defense of
rape. Outside of this interview platform are other high-octane trolls
who in some case are literally tattooing swastikas on their chests.

Every time I tweet about this, I am guaranteed a response or two from
some (and thanks, John Scalzi, for the reminder of the term) useful
idiot who will tell me:

Too late; you stand with rape apologists, literal nazis, threateners
of murder. The burden of proof is on you.

I drifted a bit from my core point here, which is this: Even if SJW as
a movement is sometimes guilty of excessive zeal, I would rather stand
beside them than opposed to them, because the core aim is a valid one,
and moving slowly and haltingly towards the right place is where I
want to be. I can try fix the worst excesses from the *right* side of
the fight.
