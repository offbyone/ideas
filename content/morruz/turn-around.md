Well, as of today, we turn around and begin the return with a 12 hour overnight bus tonight to Neuquen, the start of Argentina´s wine country.

Yesterday we had the experience of seeing 3 orcas cruise the shore in front of us looking for sea lion snacks, they were only about 20m off shore and we were about 100m from the shore, so close.  The whole crowd on shore seemed to be cheering for the orcas and not the cute little sea lion pups.  On the drive back our bus driver tried to balance our full 13 passenger bus on two wheels in the ditch, interesting.  500m down the road a truck had actually rolled just in front of us.  Saw guacunas, more penguins, you get within a meter of them, various local avians.

This desolate area is something, they get 500mm of rain annually yet it´s almost desert flora.  We got rain soaked yesterday, in fact Morris was out looking at sea elephants in the rain when lightning struck within 1/5 of a mile.  Kaboom.

Lots of travellers down here, swiss, british, auzzies (not many) dutch, germans, and a few north americans, lots of travelling Chileans and Argentinians.  This is a great travel destination for alomost everybody.

Take care everybody, see you whenever, moi
