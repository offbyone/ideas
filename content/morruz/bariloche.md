Ahh.  A destination Dad first heard about 2 years ago, then read more about in the Travel section of the Edmonton Journal, then thought about when we were on this side of the equator last year, and now we've been there.  It was an excellent four days, and well worth the wait.

Where to begin?  Even as I was trying to catch up in my travel journal, I was discovering that I was missing so much, as pretty much every aspect of every day spent here is worth mentioning, in one way or another.  I guess I'll try to separate it by categories:

**The Hostel** we stayed at was fantastic.  It was a bit of an uphill walk to get to it, though it proved to be worth it.  Basically a cottage in the backyard, with a beautiful flower garden (where we sat in the morning for coffee and in the evening for a glass of wine) and just three double rooms, which were inhabited by others just half of the time we were there (and always by nice and interesting people).  The lady who runs the place is a spry 84-year old Slovenian named Milena, whose son lives in Toronto and was visiting for the week.  Milena was very helpful in answering all our questions from what to do to where to eat.

**The Food**  was amazing.  Our first night in Argentina we went to a very well-recomended Steak house, Alberto's, where we had our first real steak dinner.  It was very good, comparable to Alberta Beef, I would go so far as to say, and we even managed to order it rare.  The next night we tried fondue, which was really only middle of the road, as the sauces were nothing like we've been led to expect from other culinary experiences thus far.  Then we had planned to visit a restaurant recommended in one of our travel books, but instead ended up saying "we'll have what they're having" at a bar/restaurant where we'd stopped along the way.  Neither Dad nor I were particularly hungry, after a long day in the sun, and we ended up with a supremely tasty platter consisting of several pickled tidbits, and a large assortment of smoked meats, sausages, and cheeses, including all the favorites of the region: jabali (wild boar), ciervo (deer), and trucha (trout).  Wow.  And just what we wanted, in terms of type and amount.

**The Sights**  were indescribable.  And even the pictures we took won't do them justice.  How to begin?... I guess just to tell you all to come down and see for yourselves :)  Yeah.  Bariloche is on the shore of a large lake dotted with islands in the midst of several smaller lakes surrounded by mountains big and small, below and above tree-line, some still snow-capped even in the heat of summer.  Argentina's (and possibly South America's) largest and most popular ski resort is here, on the Mountain Catedral.  In the summer, instead of shutting right down they keep a couple of lifts open which take you to very close to the summit, and from the drop-off point it is just a 40min walk to the peak, where you get the most awe-inspiring view we've had yet (and that's saying alot) into the next vally and across the spine of the Andes, taking in Volcan Tronador (which is dead) and in the far distance, another volcano that is active, which we passed by when we were still in Chile.  I'm sure our pictures won't do it justice.  On another day we ascended a smaller chair lift to the top of Cerro Campanerio, which was less than half as high as Catedral, but afforded great views of the valley we were in such as the various legs and arms of the surrounding lakes, the islands, and little towns in the area.

**The People**  were so friendly.  From our lovely old Slovenian lady running the hostel, to the waiters and waitresses who were eager to try their english out on us, to Alfredo, a nice man who picked Dad and I up on a deserted road we were hiking on in the heat of the day that turned out to be alot longer than we'd been led to believe and brought us the rest of the way to the cool, inviting lake at the end of it, but not before inviting us into his cabaña, introducing us to his family, and sharing a cool glass of pear juice with us.

All of this and more has contributed to a great trip so far, and we hope it continues thus.
