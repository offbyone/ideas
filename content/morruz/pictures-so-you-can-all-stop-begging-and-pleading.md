Okay, I know a couple of you have asked, and now I'm going to post a few to help catch you all up. This is just a sample, I can't post them all now for you cause then you would have no reason to see us in person when we get back, and some of you we like enough to spend time with. And it's not right up to date, as you will see from Dad's post under this one, we had an exciting day yesterday.
