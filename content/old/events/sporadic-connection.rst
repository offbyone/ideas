Well, the move is happening either this weekend or over the coming week.
This is going to result in some \_very\_ sporadic communications, as our
phone will not be moved over until the 15th of the month. I can't even
attest to the usual rapidity of my e-mail responses, since when we move
I'll be re-wiring the new place to allow connection to occur. Still, I
hope to be somewhat in touch.

Anyway, I am still hating this. I like the house and would rather stay,
but the situation dictates otherwise, to my dismay.

Hope you all have a good weekend. As for me, on top of all of this, it's
back to class on Monday.

Oh, and some (possibly) good news, too! I had an interview with [ACI
Worldwide](http://www.aciworldwide.com/)'s e-Courier development wing
for an internship position, and they seemed to be fairly pleased with
me. I should know by Friday whether I got it or not. W00t!

### Update

Well, I imagine most readers won't really get why this is hard, but I'll
be shutting down the whole house network and moving all of my PCs today.
As opposed to tomorrow, when I move. This is the first time that my
computers have moved at a different time than me, and it's... not easy.

Yes, it's not a big deal to most of you, and it wouldn't be even if they
were your computers. But it's a pretty big deal to me.
