| This is the first of (hopefully) many postings in a new vein here. I'm
  not going to promise anything special, but the people I'll write about
  under this heading are my friends. This will be why I care, who they
  are to me, and all that jazz. Since it's not of interest to everyone,
  I'll keep the bulk of the text off of the front page, but here's the
  first one: Beau.

| How do I even begin to explain this guy?

Beau is an interesting person, a study in contradictions from some
angles, and probably one of the best people I've ever met. He is
remarkably intelligent, although he does a good job of tucking that side
of himself away, so as not to offend people who take offense at that
kind of thing. He's ostentatious, sometimes crude and cruel, but it's
more because of assuming that people are like him than it is explicit
malice on his part.

In a lot of ways, he is the yin to my yang. We are congruent in many of
our ideas, but not to the point of groupthink or syncophancy. Where we
differ, he is a complement to me. He is social where I am solo. He is
outgoing where I am retiring. When I wish that I was a nonloner, I wish
that I was like him.

I have hurt him, in ways both large and small. I remember the look on
his face, out of the corner of my eye, as I kissed the girl he was
pining after. I remember worrying that I had ruined our friendship then.
I'm not always willing to take time out of my solitude to spend with
him, and I know that this hurts him. I wish that I could make him
understand that it's not his fault, I'm just like that.

He has hurt me. He dated a girl in college specifically because I had
expressed interest in her. He is casually rude sometimes, and leaves me
wondering what he's really thinking.

Beau is largely responsible for who I am today. He brought me out of my
shell in that first year of college. From a weak start (His first words
to me? "What, you're in this class too? Christ, you're so fucking
annoying!") we progressed to real friendship. I still remember his madly
grinning face as he shoved my shy and nervous ass into the mosh pit at a
Watchmen concert at GPRC. He insisted that it was for my own good,
although I suspect that at the time he may have had harm on his mind ;)

Meeting people and not fearing that they would hurt me was a new thing
then. Having someone other than myself that I could count on to back me
up. Trusting anyone at all. These were all of the new things that Beau
taught me how to do.

I am not a sociable person. I never will be. But I owe what little skill
I have in a social arena to this man.

Beau is my friend, and I'm proud to know him.
