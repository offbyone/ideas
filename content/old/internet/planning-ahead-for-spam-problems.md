Hey, all.

I\'ve noticed a \_huge\_ spike in spam coming in to the site of late \--2,900 in the last three months, which is bloody ridiculous. Which is why I\'d like to ask anyone that posts here with some regularity to please use the register link below, or \"this one\":http://www.offlineblog.com/wp-register.php.

If you register, and log in (see below for login link, in the \"Meta\" section) then your info will always be filled in when you post comments, and there is exactly 0 chance of you getting caught in my increasingly more draconian spam filtering.

I regret the need to even bring this to your attention, but I\'m running out of options. The volume is so high that there is no way I can check to see if a normal person got caught in it, which just\... sucks.
