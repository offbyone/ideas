Found on the interweb a short time ago, and brought again to my attention today by the good folks at MetaFilter:

[Events since Duke Nukem Forever was announced](http://duke.a-13.net/).

This is a bit of a sobering list of things that have happened since DNF was announced nine+ years ago. The truly jarring one is the fact that NASA \-- amongst the most legendarily ponderous bureaucracies in North America \-- "proposed, authorized, announced, designed, launched and successfully landed [the two Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity] upon Mars where they have been exploring the surface for over 2.5 years."

Wow.
