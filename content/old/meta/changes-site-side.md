Just so that all of my (three) loyal readers know, i\'ve changed the tool that i\'m using for this journal to something that *i hope* i\'ll be better able to maintain. The new tool is called [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org) and it seems to be, well, naturally prettier at least :)

Here\'s to the eventual redesign by my brother, cos he\'s the real [talent](http://www.dollsap.com/) at webdesign in the family.
