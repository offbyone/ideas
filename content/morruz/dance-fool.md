The ballet last night was fantastic. There was whirling and twirling, hopping and skipping, loving and fighting. Honestly, it was way more exciting and... easy to follow than I would have expected. Granted, I had read the synopsis beforehand, but still.

We're east of Praha, and despite being in the old Moravian capital of Brno, the amount of english around us has dropped quite significantly. We're in the touristy downtown (significantly less so than Praha's), but even so it's a bit of a crapshoot to find someone who speaks english. This is why it's somewhat impressive that I happened to turn the charm onto who I imagine is one of the few fluent english speakers. The upshot is that I spent a very pleasant evening visiting and wandering with her last night, and I'm supposed to give her a call when we come back through this way.

And now, on to Poland.
