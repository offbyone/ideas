Jesus, this can be a loud town. Every time I think that the noise level is going to die down, my stereo *in the house* is drowned out by the revelry without.

I can\'t really fault them, though. Although many of the enthusiasts out there probably weren\'t even literate the last time that the Oilers made it to the conference finals \-- apparently on a goal scored by their now-\*coach\*, for some perspective \-- that hasn\'t stopped them, and shouldn\'t stop them, from taking some enjoyment from the event. I\'ll admit, I don\'t get the whole \"pride in the team\" thing \-- we have little to do with them winning, except in the sense that we provide the pay that keeps the team here, and the live crowd is like a creature of its own, goading through sheer force of adrenaline. The average man on the street, however, contributes nothing directly. So, the pride thing\... Well, whatever works.

Me, I think back to the Dynasty and note that this is the way an underdog team makes a run at the Cup.
