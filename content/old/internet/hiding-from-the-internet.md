I think that tomorrow I\'ll just \... avoid .. the internet. The place turns into a pile of utter shit once per year, on 1 April, as every two-bit dumb shit gets the mistaken impression that we all just stop caring about anything at all, and decides that pink site redesigns and fake album releases are actually *funny*.

Asshats.
