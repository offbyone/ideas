Well folks this is not an exiting week as we are just waiting around Ushuaia for the trip. The weather in Ushuaia, everyday, would be rain, clouds wind & sun, cool temperatures. We pretty much are always wearing coats and rain jackets. We have found good food and met interesting people in abundance. Yesterday at lunch we invited a couple to join us as all the tables were full. The lady was staring at my shirt, they were from Praha and did not expect to see that shirt down here.  
As far as emails, expect quite a dead time while we´re sailing as internet is \$3 US a minute on the boat. We will try to send some info sometime, otherwise, we´re leaving the site open to not clutter up C&C´s trip.  
Enjoy like all, moi
