Well, to anyone that wants to get hold of me in the near- to mid-term
future, be aware that I'm going to be somewhat out of touch. Thanks to
the necessity of money and paying for school with it, I am obliged to
get my ass out of town and make a bunch of it. The downside to this?
Well, let's just say I'll miss my (various) favourite things from home.
And my computers.

Anyway, I'll be catching up on my e-mail pseudo-weekly, so i hope not to
be missing completely.
