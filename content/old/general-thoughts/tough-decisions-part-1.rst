Something I have never looked forward to is knowing that inevitably I
will be looking for `advice <http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/14654>`__ on
when and how to put down a pet. There's definitely a part of me that
just hopes that mine won't need it, that they'll be the freak mutation
cats that live as long as I do. Of course the rational side of me knows
better.

Still, the link above was full of good advice, advice that I intend to
heed when the time comes (which is not now, in case anyone was
panicking! All of our cats are as healthy as ever, if completely
insane).
