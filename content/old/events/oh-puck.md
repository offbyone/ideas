So, no tickets for me.

Mere seconds (about two) after the seat reservation system came online, I clicked through and got... denied.

I'd use a hockey metaphor, here, but none seem to be coming to mind. And they're all goofy anyway.

So, I'll have to wait to see another playoff game, I guess. Bummer.
