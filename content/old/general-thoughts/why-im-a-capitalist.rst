Dependency.

More specifically, I'm unconvinced that it's for the best to depend on
others for the necessities and desires of life any more than is
absolutely necessary.

As an example, obviously only one data point, take the Greyhound strike
that is going on right now. This is a case where, because the users of
the service are dependent on the providers in a very clear,
often-inextricable fashion, the providers of the service have been able
to cause them no end of grief by withholding service.

Make no mistake; I believe that the other component of this is that
those that provide a service are freely allowed to decline to continue
to provide it, for whatever reason they choose. I don't have to agree
with the reason, just with the right to perform the action.

This acceptance, however, leads me to my main point, which is that
depending on others for services is a dangerous game; you are gambling
that they'll never choose to revoke that service, despite the fact that
threatening to do so at times when the service is most needed to \_you\_
results in immense potential gains for \_them\_. It's unlikely in normal
relations: One's friends rarely say "Oh, you \_need\_ a ride? Sorry, I'm
not giving rides anymore... for free." This doesn't hold with people for
whom you are just another inconveniencecustomer, however.

So, think twice before you make choices that increase your dependency on
third parties that do not have an interest in your wellbeing. I do.
