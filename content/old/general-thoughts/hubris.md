I attended the first meeting of the school year for the U of A's Machine Learning Reading Group yesterday, and I was struck by how staggeringly out of my depth I was. The round table was surrounded by professors, graduate students, postdocs, department heads, and one other undergrad student \-- the organizer of the session. And me.

I'm starting to wonder if perhaps I'm taking on too much. Not the classes, per se, but the extracurricular stuff.

On the other hand, thanks to a bit of prodding from said organizer, I'm starting to rediscover my interests in AI, which had fallen by the wayside over the years as I was outside of academia. Maybe that's what I'm interested in? I hope to find out someday soon :)
