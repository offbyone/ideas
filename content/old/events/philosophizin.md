Oh, and in other news, my local hockey team beat their local hockey team. And what a game, it was. Wow.

In yet other news, did anyone notice the geographically-relevant link list down and to the right? I've added "Sites near me" to the sidebar. It's possible that there's even a useful community of bloggers in Edmonton. Although, odds are slim.
