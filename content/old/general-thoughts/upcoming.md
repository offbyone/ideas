Well, final exams are coming at a rapid clip, and I\'m more or less prepared for them. More, hopefully, rather than less. Which is a bit of a lead-in to something i\'ve been considering for a while: Is it me, or is this weblog perhaps a bit inaccurately-named? I\'ve looked over the last many posts and i don\'t really see a lot of postings about school.

I started this out as a way to get some of my own insecurities ironed out about going back to school so much older than I ever wanted to. Instead, i found that after a while, it just stopped bothering me. So, i started talking about other things. I guess it\'s progress ;-)

So, the obvious question is, what should i call it?
