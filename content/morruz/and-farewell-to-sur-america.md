Well folks, this is our last full day south of that imaginary line of equinox. I must say that this trip just increased my pleasure at visiting down here and I strongly recommend this as a destination.  
We often finish a post and then remember much more that we could have said but like Morris says. that's why people actually hang around with us, we don't give it all away too early. So, you'll have to visit with us, in person, to hear the rest of the story.  
Other than that, Isabell and Walter warmly greated us to Mendoza as did their hijos. This was special for us and capped off this trip. Last night, at El Buque, we had another fantastic steak meal, perfectly cooked, it is probably our favorite restaurant down here. Tommorrow we do the pass, one of the nicest pieces of highway to drive over. Then plane, then join you all for your gloriously warm spring.  
Luv, moi
