Well, this might be fun. A bit of link-hopping late last night has left me thinking\...

What the sexes \_really\_ need is \[a little bit\](<http://niceguy.dearingfilm.com/index.php> \"NiceGuy\'s Women Suck Page!\") of \[misogyny\](<http://www.misanthropic-bitch.com/> \"The Misanthropic Bitch\") and \...

Hm.

Now\... what, precisely, does it say about the two sites linked above when I can\'t find commensurately misandristic websites? Kinda makes you wonder.

Bear in mind, the two sites i link here are extremes, and I\'m not professing agreement across the board with them at all. The first one, to NiceGuy\'s page, I have to admit i\'ve seen a lot of those behaviours before. And the media portrayal of men he points out is pretty much bang-on: Men in the media these days are mostly emasculated and/or moronic.

That being said, mostly what\'s funny is the sheer \_amount\_ of bile being spewed. It\'s all well and good to get a feeling that you\'re a bit hard done by. But this guy\... There\'s literally \_hours\_ of material here.

Before someone crucifies me, though\...

\_It\'s funny\_. \*\*Laugh\*\*.

\### Update

On reflection, \[this\](<http://www.despair.com/demotivators/dysfunction.html>) would seem to be a good comment, wouldn\'t it?
