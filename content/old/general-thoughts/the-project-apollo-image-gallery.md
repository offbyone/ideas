NASA has just updated [the Project Apollo Image Gallery](http://www.apolloarchive.com/apollo_gallery.html) with photos from the Apollo 11 mission.

Although at present the site is still \[slashdotted\](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdotted>) into submission, preventing me from actually viewing the images, I wanted to make sure that you all saw them.

A return soon, I hope.
