As has been posted to [char's weblog](http://www.livejournal.com/users/xraystar/) in the near past, I'm back in GP for the week. It's kind of interesting - i've been going out of my way to be a bit more sociable than i usually am on these visits, and oddly enough, I'm liking it.

Which is, given my antipathy to the place, fairly peculiar in and of itself.

Anyway, Just a post to keep people aware that no, i'm not dead.

And yes, my dad is doing fine.
