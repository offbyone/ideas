It was around seven years ago this time, at least in terms of course outlines, that i essentially gave up on making any progress in school. Around now, i failed to complete the major essay assignment in my full-year English course, and pretty much stopped attending classes.

It was with no small degree of satisfaction that i handed in the research essay that parallels that assignment yesterday morning. Whatever else comes, i did not buckle where i did last time, and from here on in, it's all new ground. I'm looking forward to it more and more.
