Well, the flight from Nairobi went well and figuring out the underground of London also went well, I was waiting outside the Bangor station when Sion showed up.

On the last day in Africa I went to my watering hole, nothing to do with a specific lady working there, really. Later we went out to the Carnivore restaurant but was only able to add crocodile to my taste buds and likely won't again, salty and fishy beyond what I like. Otherwise, they just kept bring skewers of meat and carving for us until we lowered our flag.  
Said goodbye to that group and life continues.  
Finally looked through my pictures with Simon and some turned out not too bad, we'll add some tomorrow. S&J and me will do supper tonight and life will continue.
