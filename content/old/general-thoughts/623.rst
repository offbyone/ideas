### Update

Interestingly, today Bruce Schneier wrote an article about culture's
[war on the
unexpected](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/the\_war\_on\_the.html)
that fits really nicely with this. It illustrates the flat-out falsehood
of the statement "\_If you've done nothing wrong, you've got nothing to
fear.\_"

I have a hard time reading this; I realize that it's unlikely that any
of this will happen to me, but that's not because it \_can't\_, it's
because on some level I'm already suppressed in that way. This stuff
makes me sick inside.
