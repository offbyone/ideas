Well, Harry and I have arrived in lovely (snowy) Vancouver, after a great few days spent boarding and driving through the Rocky Mountains. Our first day at Fernie was great but chilly at -23. The snow there is just amazing though, you can see how the mountain resorts are predicting a bumper year for skier volumes. That evening we drove the rest of the way to Kimberley and had a wonderful dinner and visit with the MacDonald-Ferries, with all four members of the family in attendance. Visiting there gave us a chance to drive Hwy3 all the way to Vancouver, a route I have never taken before, but which is just amazingly beautiful. And also very snow-covered, so it was good to have a break partway along in Rossland, where we stopped for two nights and boarded on the fantastic (and pretty much deserted) Red Mountain. It'll be neat to fly to the Patagonian Andes with views of the Canadian Rockies so fresh in my mind to compare them to.

So now I have a couple of days to spend here in Vancouver and Victoria doing some visiting before the big flight out on Monday morning.
