Well, my computer is fixed, although I'm a bit nonplussed; the performance on it seems poorer, and the fan is running faster. I'm not quite sure what's going on, and I'm going to call Applecare to ask about it, but in the main it's good to have the beastie back.

It might be moot, soon, anyway, since my work laptop is due to _ship_ one of these days from Dell. It's been a long, long wait, but soon I'll have a machine with some real horsepower to get work done on, and additionally it'll make a sweet Windows box for \_completely sanctioned work-related activity for stress-relief purposes\_.

;)
