Well, my life is officially boring.

I've managed to do little or nothing interesting for the past week, basically phoning it in in class, and doing some of the work that just \... needs doing, at work. All told, not a bad week, but not one loaded with amusing anecdotes or anything.

I'm supposed to go over to a friend's place for a beer after work tonight, if that counts as exciting.

Other than that, I've now tried a sort of mead, although not a purist's sort, and it was good.

See? _Exciting_!
