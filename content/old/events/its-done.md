Today, at long last, the X-prize, for the first private, re-usable, passenger-capable space launch [was won]([http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/xprize2_success_041004.html](http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/xprize2_success_041004.html)) by Scaled Composites' SpaceShipOne when it made its second flight within two weeks to the boundary of earth's atmosphere.

Proof that governments aren't needed to make it in to space.

Proof that dedication can give men wings.

Proof that even I might see the edge of our atmosphere before the end of my life.

Words, really, fail me. This is a good thing, a very good thing.
