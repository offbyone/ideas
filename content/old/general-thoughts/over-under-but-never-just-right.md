Here's something interesting... Bruce Schneier writing about [people's overreactions to risk](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/05/rare_risk_and_o.html), a topic near and dear to my heart.

Security theatre is no new thing to any of us; we all see instances of it in the invasive checks while boarding planes (shoe bombs? Did anyone actually think that'd work?) and the preemtive measures taken to prevent hollywood threats that are neither plausible, nor likely (I'm thinking laptop bombs, et al).

It's not like I have anything approaching a solution here, of course --it's just bloody frustrating that this keeps happening.
