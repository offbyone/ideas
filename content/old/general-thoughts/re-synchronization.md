What am I up to?

Not much \-- I'm very very bored, these days. I suppose I could work on work stuff\... Or I could work on some kind of personal coding project. But I just don't feel like it.

I read Michael Crichton's *State of Fear* last night, though. It's weird \-- it's like he was a better-writing Ayn Rand. The book was more of a statement of philosophy than it was a novel, although it had that, as well. The most interesting part of it was the philosophical part, though. He's something of a student of [Bjorn Lomborg](http://www.lomborg.com/), in the sense that he believes that the simplistic solutions we propose for environmental living are insufficient and/or just plain misinformed. He's got a point, I think.

Which reminds me, I need to borrow that book from Mom\...
