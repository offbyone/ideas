As can also be gleaned over [here](http://www.offlineblog.com/mildillson/index.php?p=260), \"Doom 3\":http://www.doom3.com/ has been released, and I have acquired a copy for myself as well. I\'m holding off purchasing it until payday (or the one after \-- but I *am* going to buy it)

Jebus, this game is gorgeous.

And scary.

I just played for an hour now, and I\'m into the part where the game becomes, well, Doom.

I\'m not really sure how to put this other than as point form lines. The game is tense, dark, scary, atmospheric. The sound is phenomenal. The enemies are creepy. Ammo is, if not scarce, rarer than I\'d like it to be. Did I mention that the sound is phenomenal?

The above traits, minus the graphics praise, could almost be pulled directly from reviews of another game I tout to anyone that asks: \[System Shock 2\](<http://www.sshock2.com/>).

I don\'t think that this is a coincidence.

Now, if only I had slightly higher-end hardware to run this work of art on.
