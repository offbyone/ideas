Had a great time with Eric and company at his bachelor party last night.
This one won't win any awards for hardcore crazy times, but that's more
my speed anyway. The entertainments included political snarkery,
literary pretensions, laser tag, and Dragonball on the Wii. All of these
things are good fun, and really, what would life be like without them?

I did, however, oversleep a bit this morning. I blame the fact that I've
not topped 6 hours of sleep in any night for around a month, which is
probably not doing my body any good whatsoever.

In other news, Mother's day is coming, and I'm pretty stoked: \_I
remembered\_! ;)
