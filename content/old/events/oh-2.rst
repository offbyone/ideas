Can anyone reading this do me a big favour and post any events and links
that I might want to keep my eyes on to this thread? I hope to keep up
w/ the news in the papers while at work, but time doesn't always permit.
As a result, I tend to lose track.

I'd appreciate any help that my loyal readers can offer. Thanks, all!
