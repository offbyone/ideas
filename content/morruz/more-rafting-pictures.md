Okay, now that I know it's possible, here are a few more pictures. This series is from right at the beginning of our trip, where the guide was teaching us how to respond to comands, one of which is to 'jump to the left', which is to be used when the raft is alongside a big wave, and all of us have to be in the left side of the raft to keep it from flipping. But for the practice you can see we arein calm water, and our guide (que chico malo) told us to make sure we had our bodies so far to the left that they were outside of the boat. Well, the pictures tell the story of how well that worked:

(Dad is in the in the front of the raft on the left -the second red helmet from the front- and I am the one jumping to the left just behind him -the 3rd red helmet)
