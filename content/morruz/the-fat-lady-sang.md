In so many more ways than one. We watched our last opera in Praha last night. We stayed out far too late, and got the diva drunk enough to sing in the bar (holy shit it was loud but beautiful) and of course, we are out of the Czech Republic. So Cajmin and I are going on a collective of about 3 or 4 hours sleep, but the company was totally worth it, as was the deep fried cheese in Simon\`s case, I\`m sure. \`\`I\`ve Never\`\` is a totally fun drinking game. You learn so much about your drinking mates!

Yesterday in my travells, I dazzled one of the local boys with my fantastic wit (well, it\`s only a letter or two off) and beautiful smile. As I was buying a nice pressie for a certain someone, I totally got hit on by one of the local boys. Good thing he wasn\`t as cute as the boys in Poland, cause I might have been in trouble! (definitely the hottest boys in the 4 countries) I poitely and with a ridiculous girlish giggle declined the offer for a date later that night, and (half) ran blushing out of the store.

\*NB\* please do not burst my bubble about european boys asking everyone out, I am in my own fantasy world here...

So, it\`s Frankfurt and the world cup, and Cajmin and I are debating weather or not Partying is going to ensue tonight. I know it will around us, but I\`m not sure if we will (can) participate. I know I need a change of clothes, and a bath, and to wash my laundry. All my undies are good, but I\`m afraid the rest has been neglected. The joys of travelling, I guess.

I\`m not sure what else to say, but I can\`t wait to show all my pictures, and to talk with all my hommies, and to touch another human being. Three weeks is a lot without so much as a pat on the shoulder. It\`s also been far too long since I\`ve heard the purrrrrr of my kitties. :(
