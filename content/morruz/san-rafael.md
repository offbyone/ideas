If you ever plan on visiting Argentina, put this city on your itinerary, extremely pretty surrounded by orchards, vineyards and to the west the Andes. We actually did some real estate shopping, a 5 Ha vineyard with older house, \$160,000 APeso and only 7km from center of town just past the airport and golf course.
