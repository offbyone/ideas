Well, interesting news from back home yesterday: As reported \"in\":http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20040709/NATS09-2/TPNational/Canada \"a\":http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/WinnipegSun/News/2004/07/09/532750.html \"few\":http://www.dailyheraldtribune.com/Z05_00btornado0709.lasso \"places\":http://edmonton.cbc.ca/regional/servlet/View?filename=ed_tornado20040709 \"here\":http://www.canada.com/edmonton/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=5ca8f460-95d1-4ddb-b5d9-0725686c3a94 \"and\":http://www.dailyheraldtribune.com/Z04_00aswath0709.lasso [there](http://www.livejournal.com/users/pegs/227728.html), a tornado touched down in Grande Prairie. Kind of wacky. Even scarier, it seems that my dad \-- always one to stay out of trouble usually \-- was smack dab in the path of the winds and even had the windows of his truck blown out by the winds\... Just before arriving to renew his insurance. Timing one can\'t even \_invent\_.

So, everyone, make with the \"blown away\" jokes now.
