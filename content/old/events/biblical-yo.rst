What a downpour.

It started about 14:45 just before Char had to leave for work, and as we
got ready to drive there, it was picking up to mammoth volumes including
hail and low, threatening clouds. We drove her to work, gingerly, and
then I made my way home.

Returning home, I was forced to detour repeatedly, avoiding flooded
stretches of road in places like Calgary Trail North Even avoiding
those, I was stuck four times in a position where I had to go through 30
metres or so of 30cm-deep water to get where I was going.

Picked up a couple of ladies who had had their van stall out just south
of one avenue and drove them the remaining 15 blocks to their house. I
felt pretty good, very good-samaritan.

Then, I got home.

In my basement was 2cm of water covering 80% of the TV room floor,
having come in via the saturated ground through permanent cracks in the
foundation.

So, a more or less frantic removal of furniture was accomplished with
the timely aid of "Aaron":http://www.spaz.ca who made the voyage, nay,
\_odyssey\_ to assist me through streets made into rivers by this
massive flood.

Life is icky, cold, and wet. I know, because to see if the roads were
clear, I tossed on some shoes I never wear and hopped on my bike to tot
around the neighborhood. Most of the water is gone, so I am going out in
a minute to pick up some ribs. I deserve them.

Hopefully Jacques gets here soon with the shop-vac so that I can suck up
some of the water here.
