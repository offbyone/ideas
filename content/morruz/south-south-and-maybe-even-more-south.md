So tomorrow we leave the known world and enter the unknown. Because of the poblems with the ferry that I mentioned earlier, we are not going that way, so instead tomorrow we make the big leap down South by plane. We will arrive in Punta Arenas (54 degrees south) tomorrow afternoon. There's lots to see around there, and in and around nearby Puerto Natales, and then of course there is Ushuaia on the Argentinian side of things. By the sounds of it, we will be able to spend quite a bit of time on that little skinny bit of land enjoying the wilderness at the end of the world.
