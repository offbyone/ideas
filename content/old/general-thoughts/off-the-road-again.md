I'm back from my brief stint out working again, and this time it's for more than a week. Or sorta. My vacation is set in stone nearly from beginning to end, but at least it's set in _relaxing_ stone, as opposed to the irritating, stuck in your shoes variety. So I'm looking forward to most of it.

I'm hoping that the time away from work will afford me the opportunity to see a few of the friends that have been too long absent from my life (I'm looking at _you_, all you people that skipped my party last month!) and maybe just to unwind a bit. It's gonna be tough to go back.
