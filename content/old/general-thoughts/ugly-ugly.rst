Well, that's coming back to bite me on the ass.

I just managed to have one of the most horrible exams ever. Every
question was a total blank for me on first read.

God damn.

I'd have to do phenomenally on this to come out with a B in the course,
and I suspect that "phenomenal" is not an accurate description of my
performance.
