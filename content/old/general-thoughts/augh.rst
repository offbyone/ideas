Well, that was the hardest exam i have ever had the... \_privilege\_ ...
of taking.

Ew

Oh, it's not like it wasn't stuff we covered in class, because we
\_did\_ cover it, but as soon as i sat down to do it, all of the
material drained out of my head like coffee from a cheap paper cup. It
was sad.

And a bit humbling, too. I know i'm overconfident sometimes, but it
never really registers til something like this walks up and kicks me in
the face. I feel like i don't know a damned thing, and i hate it.

Yeah, i know, i say this every time something trips me up. You'd think
i'd get the idea. The problem is, i usually \_am\_ nearly as good as i
think i am. It isn't conducive to humility.
