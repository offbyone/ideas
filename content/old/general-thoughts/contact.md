Hey, all you craaaazy\...

Okay, that is definitely not \_my\_ tone, there.

Seriously, though, what are all of you up to? I know \[Matt\](<http://www.offlineblog.com/mildillson>) is done for the summer, but of course is swamped with lesson planning for the heavy \[workload\](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workload>) of next year. Another sometime reader has just \[gotten\](<http://www.asylus.com/2005/07/engaged.html>) \[engaged\](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement>), which is cool news, and Mom is settling in at home. The usual suspects, etc\...

But (what with moving) the only one of you I\'ve really seen a lot of this \[summer\]([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial\\\_tilt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial\_tilt)) is \[Simon\](<http://vernondalhart.livejournal.com/>), who \-- while cool, and all \-- is only a small part of my circle of valued friends.

We\'re almost set here to host some sort of get-together, and I intend to invite everyone that reads this (and a few that don\'t, those technologically-\[backward\](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite> \"Those wacky loom-wreckers!\") people who for some reason think I\'m a decent sort). Dates will be forthcoming. Apparently \[Char\](<http://xraystar.livejournal.com>) is drooling over the idea of hosting a \[cocktail party\]([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail\\\_party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail\_party)) :)
