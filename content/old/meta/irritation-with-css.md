As per the previous entry, there are some Stylesheet glitches with the site. So, here's the deal. If you think the site looks like shit, get a good browser. [IE6](http://microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp) and [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org) (and, by extension, [Netscape 6+](http://www.netscape.com/)) will render the site just fine. Opera and earlier versions of the big two browsers don't. So, since i'm both A) lazy and B) sick and tired of beating my head on poor CSS implementations, there will be no more changes to the stylesheet for purposes of browser support. Thank you for your attention.
