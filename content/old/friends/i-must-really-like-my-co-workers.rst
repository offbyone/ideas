I say this, because in a couple of weeks I'm going to assist in throwing
five of them (at least, and one non-co-worker) out of an aeroplane.

I collected their deposits today, and tomorrow I head out to the drop
zone to drop them off. The best part? Because I've had my next ten jumps
covered by a birthday gift, I can afford to hand off the discount I get
from this to two good friends who otherwise could not afford to go
again, for a few good reasons.

So this is a win all around.
