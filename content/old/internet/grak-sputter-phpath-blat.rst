My god, are people twits.

[MeFi](http://www.metafilter.com/) just acquired a small add on its
front page, containing no nudity, for
[SuicideGirls.com](http://www.suicidegirls.com/), a softcore spooky-girl
porn site (that link is **not** safe for work, if you're wondering!).

The [reaction](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/mefi/8942) has been just
stupid, though. Comments like "Sadly, because of these ads, I can no
longer recommend MetaFilter to anyone"
(`link <http://metatalk.metafilter.com/mefi/8942#196100>`__) and "It is
wrong for you to take porn ad money. What a sorry day for this site."
(`link <http://metatalk.metafilter.com/mefi/8942#196081>`__) have, well,
tweaked me in an ungood kind of way.

I am currently receiving a talk on why I should not be angry at this. I
disagree, respectfully, but be aware that in the House of Chris there
are dissenting opinions.
