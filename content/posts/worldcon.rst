:summary: Fandom turns out to be pretty nifty
:status: published
   
My first Worldcon was quite the experience, given that it occurred in
conjunction with the rise of the `barking-mad puppy brigade`_ trying
to torpedo the Hugo awards. As a result, I was paying a bit more
attention to the awards than otherwise I might have, instead of just
roaming the convention and enjoying the experience.

Some impressions, though:

Fandom is an interesting intersection of two subcultures I already
know: the tech conference culture and the gamer culture. I saw a lot
of archetypes I knew, without seeing any of the individuals, which was
really, really weird. I kept expecting to trip over PyCon buddies, but
never did, and instead ended up talking to strangers a lot.

I was surprised and pleased to see the wide range of physical
abilities that make up the fan culture. Accessibility took a front
seat in the conference, and it's easy to see why as the range of
physical capabilities on display was very, very broad.

A colleague of mine was manning a table offering `pronoun badge
ribbons`_ which was a fascinating addition to the con. In general,
despite the reputation of fandom for being prone to erasing or
dismissing diversity, I saw a lot of inclusion on some fronts. I think
that racially fandom is still very, very white, but on a lot of other
fronts it's quite open.

The upshot of it was, I enjoyed the hell out of my first
Worldcon. Navel-gazing aside, I mostly wandered the con,
people-watched, and attended the many post-day parties. I'm exhausted
but happy. I foresee making these a regular thing in lieu of PAX, as
PAX may have become too big for me to properly enjoy.
