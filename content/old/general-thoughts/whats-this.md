Yesterday, just as [Char](<http://xraystar.livejournal.com>) (who recently updated her site \-- go read!) was getting set to go to work, I realized something. Tomorrow, for the first time in a _long_ time (three years) that wasn't a specific holiday, planned and scheduled, _I have a weekend off_!

Whatever will I do?
