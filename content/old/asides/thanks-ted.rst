[Aaron](http://www.spaz.ca) mentioned [TED](http://www.ted.com/) to me
some time ago as an interesting place to go for talks about the world;
technology, science, economics, politics.

I finally got around to checking it out, and I have to admit, there's a
lot there.

It's a time-consumer, no question, with the video talks running to 20
minutes each, so you might not get to see all of it at a shot, but I'm
convinced it's worthwhile. Right now I'm watching a talk on the
application of economics to explaining AIDS in Africa, and there's more
like that.

Check it out.
