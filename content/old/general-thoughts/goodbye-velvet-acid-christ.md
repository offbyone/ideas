According to a few news soruces ([here](http://australianit.news.com.au/articles/0,7204,10704524%5E15306%5E%5Enbv%5E,00.html) [and](http://www.knoxnews.com/kns/state/article/0,1406,KNS_348_3166469,00.html) [there](http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=2269116) ) the US 6th cicruit court reached a decision that any and all sampling of music is illegal unless the work is specifically licensed. As you can imagine, [the usual suspects](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/08/1355237&tid=141&tid=17) are going to have a field day with this one.

From where I sit, I think that's just stupid. There are abuses, to be sure, but sampling is a valuable addition to the toolsets of some [artists](http://www.arztpfusch.com/,) even though [others](http://www.velvetacidchrist.com/) use it as a replacement for creativity.

What could be wrong with it, if it's not overdone (whole measures, entire themes?)
