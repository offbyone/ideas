*Sur le pont D'Avignon, on y danse, on y danse*

Well, Avignon was a place of wonder, beauty and food. Oh God the Food. The City is rich with history, art, and FOOD. Chris and I spent 3 wonderful days cruising, walking, wondering, and laughing. I made it through the Palais de Papes without melting, but not without offending someone ;). We oogled gargoyles, shot each other with corks projected from crossbows, checked out the secret coffers of the Renegade Popes. Every time we passed an alcove whose statue had been taken out, I took the opportunity to insert a statue of Notre Dame de Drama Queens

We took a cruise to Arles, which takes about 2 3/4 hours, so we ate at a wonderfully leisurely pace on the way there, cruised around arles fro a few hours, Made out in a structure almost as old as Jesus Christ (it was finished about 100 years after his death) And was generrally awed at how people still lived and thrived in the modern way in homes that are 1500 years old. It's the case in Avignon as well, and probably much of Provence, but we had just learned that on our super cheesy tourist train ride

We laughed at how awesome Old guys are, especially when they are competitive

And marvelled at the scenery. Much of Provence is still very religious, so it was a bit of a shame being there on a Sunday and Monday, since that is the weekend, and not in the party sense. They close everything down. Probably good for my pocket book, cause I was in the mood to shop, and good for our bakcs, since we were a bit tight on the back pack space.

Avignon was beautiful and fun and the closest to comfortable I reached in France. Best done again in the future but only if we are renting an appartment. Cooking is a must. Freedom to roam the countryside in a car would have made 3 weeks based out of there seem short.
