Ah, a new adventure, this one without crossing any international borders, though I sure was close yesterday! My first impression of Toronto... expressways and powerlines. Oh, and lots of people in cars on the expressways. But then we finally got to Niagra Falls and got to get out and walk around eyeballing one of the great natural wonders of the world. It's pretty impressive all right, and the Canadian side of the falls is way nicer than the american side, sorry to all you south of the border types. Then we rode back into downtown Toronto (along with half of the people in the known world) and finally arrived for a great late supper on Parliment and, well... somewhere. Today will be spent walking around the downtown core browsing shops and bistros, then tonight we're seeing the Great Lake Swimmers in concert. Looking forward to it.

Oh, and so far Harry's friends are great, though he changes the subject when they try to tell me stories of when Harry was a young rascal, I wonder why...?
