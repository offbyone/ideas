Although it might appear to the casual observer that I am dead, or
perhaps comatose, I assure you that neither is the case. Rather, I have
been swamped with a combination, familiar to some of you, of school and
work that has left me with little time even to prepare for my incipient
travels (to be catalogued, as M&M's are, at
[http://www.offlineblog.com/morruz](http://www.offlineblog.com/morruz)).

Here's a capsule summary of the last couple of weeks:

| School.
| Work.

Really, that's all.

I've been trying to exercise a bit more lately, which is probably a good
idea. Char's heavy into the yoga, and she's had me join her a couple of
times, which I have found relatively pleasant, and should probably get
into more consistently. I've also actually \_used\_ the gym that comes
with our apartment, which is revolutionary in itself, and even more,
I've actually worked up a sweat by choice. Will wonders never cease?

Uhm...

Well, nothing else.

How are all of you?
