<wpg2>4657</wpg2>That's one big freaking bottle! Although we did not drink \*that\* much champagne last night, We did drink about a Rehoboam of Champage yesterday, starting around noon :) It turned out to be a pretty expensive night, lots of champagne, lots of shellfish (cold raw sea snails, yuk!) and missing the last train: 70Euros for a cab from the equivalent of Leduc to our house. Ouch. But well worth it all, in my opinion.

The Champagne making process and some other things were well learned and appreciated, the samples at the ends of the tours were nice, and each house had its own different flavor of tour, as well as champagne. At one of the houses, I ate some pilfered grapes from outside. The Pinot (noir or meunier, I couldn't tell) were really good, but the chardonnay were yuk! really small, tart, unripe.

I'd love to recount everything, but I'm distracted, and just really don't know how to tell of all the super fun times we had. We met some people, laughed, ate, drank.

INSERT_MAP

Reims (pronounced just like France the french way, but without the F. wierd, eh?) Is a beautiful town, 120 000 people live there, and beacause it's "small" the streets are wide and you can see the beautiful majesty of the French architecture for a good 200 meters at a time, something that you can't do in Paris, or even in Prague. It's a place where they'd crowned kings from the mid 5th century, so it's well kept, lots of gorgeous monuments etc. Just an all around beautiful place to be.
