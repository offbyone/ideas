After many, many hours of work, the move is finished.

Mostly, it just sucked. However, as I have had occasion to say to a few people in the last few days, if you can judge a person by the calibre of their friends, [Char](http://xraystar.livejournal.com) and I must be pretty good people.

Much thanks to all those that helped, but extra thanks to [Simon](<http://vernondalhart.livejournal.com>). without whom this move would probably have gone much longer, much harder, and much more unpleasantly. Of all those that helped, he put in the most time and the most steady effort. Thanks, bro!
