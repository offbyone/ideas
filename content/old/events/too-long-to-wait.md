It's been [thirty years](http://home.attbi.com/~danglover/apollo17.htm) since Eugene
Cernan, Harrison Schmitt, and Ronald Evans last took Apollo 17 to the
moon. In the intervening years, the attitude of the public to space
flight has become one of apathy and disinterest. Just like the Galileo
posting earlier here, this kinda makes me sad. And i'm not just
depressed by the apathy of those around me - it's not like i knew about
this either. Like many others, i have to admit that i failed to pay
attention, and - like so many other great acts - this achievement has
slipped out of memory for everyone.

I wish there was a way to show people that staying stuck on this planet
is no way to have a future. We, as a species, are best served by
planning for a time when Earth can no longer support us. And the
critical first steps must be taken early, since we cannot predict when
our time may run out, nor can we predict how long we'll need to learn to
make our ways in the greater universe. Mankind was building ships for
generations before it became safe to travel between continents -
centuries, even. So what makes anyone think that space travel will be
any different?

This has to start now.

...but i fear it won't.
