What am I up to?

Not much -- I'm very very bored, these days. I suppose I could work on
work stuff... Or I could work on some kind of personal coding project.
But I just don't feel like it.

I read Michael Crichton's *State of Fear* last night, though. It's weird
-- it's like he was a better-writing Ayn Rand. The book was more of a
statement of philosophy than it was a novel, although it had that, as
well. The most interesting part of it was the philosophical part,
though. He's something of a student of `Bjorn
Lomborg <http://www.lomborg.com/>`__, in the sense that he believes that
the simplistic solutions we propose for environmental living are
insufficient and/or just plain misinformed. He's got a point, I think.

Which reminds me, I need to borrow that book from Mom...
