Well, much like \[mel\]([http://www.livejournal.com/users/fossil_human/1383.html](http://www.livejournal.com/users/fossil_human/1383.html)) posted, day one is done.

Day two, interestingly enough, doesn't start until 2 PM :)

It wasn't as hairy as I expected. To be honest, Cmput 415 doesn't scare me too much at this stage, although having to work in groups is going to be a challenge, especially the part where I have to _find_ a group to work with in this class full of strangers, all of whom know more than I do. Cmput 379, on the other hand, has me a bit nervous. I have to learn C, which is not the simplest thing in the world, and I have to learn how to do things with it that I've never even considered before.

I suppose that I should stop buggering around and get cracking on some of the homework I have. It's interesting. I don't so much have homework as I have two major assignments and their respective due dates already. Thus, I've got to get my ass in gear.
