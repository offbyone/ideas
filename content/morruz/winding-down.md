We just had a real neat experience, I was sitting outside a supermercado waiting for Morris when I noticed a couple across the way waving at me, the Swiss couple, Petra and Rico, we had met in Peurto Madryn who had headed for Bariloche but now are here.  This is fun, just like when Casey and Beth showed up in Peurto Madryn when we had went different directions from Bariloche.

Anyway, we're in Mendoza, going to poke around, no, I still don't own a vineyard but c'est la vie.  This is also a pretty town, about 1,000,000 people, very close to the Andes.  We´ll likely spend most of the rest of our time here, jump to Valpariso for the last two nights (read SEAFOOD) then home.  So far we have managed not one visit to a Bodega but will keep trying.

Last night I had to try the local steak, T-bone (tibon), 700g, muy roja, 23 Apeso (\$9) and had a huge steak, huge filet done perfectly, ask Morris.  Simon, try San Juan reserva cognac some time.  Nice flavor.  Cost, 10 Apeso (\$3.90) and they poured me about 4 ounces, this seems to be the norm on hard liquor, looks pricey until you see how much you get.

See you all soon, moi
