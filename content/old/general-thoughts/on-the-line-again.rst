Well, as this might attest, to those who keep track of my comings and
goings, i have acheived a state of connectedness here in Mayerthorpe.
Not a great one, and i feel nastily constrained by my return to dialup,
but a connection nonetheless.

So here i am.

Work is, well, work. I'd write more about it, but I lack words to
eloquently express the bizarre combination of dreary and magnificent
that characterizes my days. From the amazing views of the trestle bridge
in fog to the town in which i stay...

How is everyone?
