I\'m sure we all know about \"google\":http://www.google.com/ since, well, we all have to find stuff sometimes. But do we all know about these funky [hidden google features](http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/20/1823206&mode=thread)?

If \"this\":http://www.google.com/search?q=speed+of+light+in+cubits+per+fortnight&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 isn\'t just the wackiest thing i\'ve ever seen on google, i don\'t know \"what is\":http://www.google.com/help/features.html (though i\'m sure someone will show me\...)
