I had a peculiarly disappointing day yesterday. Not the whole day, but a
part of it really shook my faith in the ability of people to grow in a
positive direction.

I took a bit of time to look up one of my old classmates, call him D for
the sake of anonymity. D was one of the people that i attended school
with from the beginning through to grad, and I remember always having a
fair amount of respect for his native intelligence. We were never great
friends, but he wasn't one of my principal tormentors either.

Now, D has a pretty good life -- he's getting married, owns a business
-- which I was happy to see. However, he also believes that the world is
young, it was made some excessively short time ago at the behest of a
supernatural entity, carbon dating is a sham, evolution is wrong (note,
\_not\_ "Natural Selection is wrong" -- I got told that natural
selection works fine, evolution doesn't) and, well, you get the idea.

I hate to lose respect for someone like that. But all of the residual
respect that I once had is gone now, and I'm left with a feeling of
profound disappointment.
