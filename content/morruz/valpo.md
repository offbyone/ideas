Hey all!

First of all I want to enlist all of you who know about this page to share it with others who know us, in case we didn´t get the chance to tell them all about it, due to the lateness of the idea and the scatterbrain that I sometimes can be.

So, other than that, we are now in Valpariso, just west of Santiago on the coast.  It´s really neat here, a large bay surrounded by hills that rise very steeply away from the water.  A unique aspect of this town is it´s several 'Ascensors', which are touted as escalators set into the hillside to make going up and down easier.  What they really are are kind of a small Funicular, a train car on a ·very· steep slope (With our survey eyes Dad and I figured it was less than a 2:1 in the one we've tried).  They are very useful, but can only take you so far, with so many hilly streets yet to climb to get much of anywhere above the main area near sea level.  We've made our way through a very busy fish and vegetable market, which bodes well for finding good seafood dishes in restaurants here.

So that's all for now, on we go,

Miranda

P.S.  All thoughts of visiting Antartica are out the window and far gone, as we met an elderly gentleman on the plane here who was going on a cruise there from the southern tip of Chile, and he said it was costing him \$11,000 dollars (american).  So yeah.  that´s that.
