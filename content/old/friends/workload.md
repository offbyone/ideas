To all of my friends who haven't been hearing from me lately...

My course workload is climbing at a furious rate, more or less as I expected, but as a consequence my time for personal life is falling correspondingly.

As such, I apologize :)

However, please don't let me fall off the face of the earth fully, if you can. Or at least don't forget I'm still here. I _will_ be sociable again, it'll just be a bit.
