Char and I just spent the weekend in Jasper, one of the few vacations we've taken both in north america and on short notice.

It was really, really nice.

We didn't really do a lot; lounged around the hotel, lazed in the pool, walked a bit. Maligne Canyon is freakin' gorgeous when frozen, and the road to Maligne lake is something special in itself.
