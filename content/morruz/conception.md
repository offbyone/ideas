well, we are now in the City of Conception, a mite bit south of Santiago, further south than either of us had ever been before (though to be fair even Santiago fit that bill). Valparaiso was nice, our hostel was really great, mostly for all the helpful advice we got from Patricia, the lady who runs the place. That seems to be such a constant thing, in all my travels of this great earth, that it is the people you meet that really colour your impressions of the places you visit. Just think of how much of an embassador you are of the place where you live. People could meet you and decide what they think of Canada based on how you act. Wow, what a thought. Anyways, on a lighter note, trying to decide on a place to eat in Valpo, Dad and I asked Patricia for a recomendation, and she named a place that, once we saw it, both Dad and I agreed that we never would have found the place on our own... it was a restaurant at the end of an alley, which, admittedly, you can see the sign from the street, but it says "casino" on it, and you never would have thought it was a restaurant. Well, it turned out to be a neat little local joint, with basically one dish on the menu, which is called chorillano, which is beef with onions and egg fried on french fries (yeah, a real heart-smart meal) Needless to say, it was a neat experience, with local artists providing musical entertainment throughout the night.

And now, like I said, we are in Conception, a nice enough city (where my Spanish teacher is from), and from which we will base our next couple days, touring the Pacific beaches and abandoned coal mines and the like.

that's all for now, love, mir
