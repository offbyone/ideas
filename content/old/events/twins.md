Bearing out something i've been harping on for ages with respect to the cloning debate is this [news article on CNN](http://www.usatoday.com/news/science/2003-01-21-cloned-cats_x.htm). Essentially, it consists of a description of the first cloned housecat, CC, who is nothing at all like her genetic forebear Rainbow. Amazingly enough, much like identical twins, *who share the same DNA* exactly like clones do, the cats' environments heavily influenced what sort of personality and physique and even fur coat they ended up with.

On a related note, as mentioned in the article, isn't the business name ["Genetic Savings and Clone"](http://www.savingsandclone.com/) hilarious? ;)
