After a nice ride on a coche cama, we are in the University town of Córdoba. Pretty much halfway between Buenos Aires and Mendoza. It's a cool misty morning, but if the fog lifts we might take an afternoon tour around the countryside and see what's shakin'.

Colonia de Sacramento in Uruguay did turn out to be a beautiful city. The old part is quite touristy but very quaint, with roughly cobblestoned streets (especially the ones they say are original portugese construction). Lousy gradation and compaction of the base,... Dad says he never would have let it pass inspection. We highly recommend Uruguay. The small part of it we saw was great, and from conversations with locals we hear that the rest of it is quite spectacular as well. I really thought we were paring down the list of things to see here, but noooo.

Tonight we take another night bus to get to our final destination before the departure point. We made a phone call to Mendoza yesterday and were instantly remembered and are warmly expected tomorrow morning. Yay, what a way to cap off a trip.

p.s. I finally put some new pictures up. They may not be in order, but oh well
