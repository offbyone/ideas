I\'d think that it would have become easier, with time. I just bloody *hate* travelling. Every minute I have to spend in a car between the place from which I depart and that at which I arrive is a little piece of hell, even with people I like.

Bah.

Still, the destination itself was nice. I had a good time seeing parts of the family I\'ve avoided assiduously for some time now, for reasons that have \... decreased in significance (and severity) with time. All in all, it was a pleasant time. Now, I have to work on little sleep on stupid configuration bugs and hassles with finicky PEBKAC errors.

Buggery.

I really could have done without the fire alarm the second I walked in the door, delaying my *much* needed coffee by about 30 minutes.
