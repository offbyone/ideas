Just finished going over a short story in ENGL-101 today called "The
Lame Shall Enter First" and - whoah - did this story ever leave me
feeling, well, strongly. So, the story is basically about - in terms of
subject - the failure of a father to pay attention to his son, and the
son's response. There's a lot going on here, though, and a lot of it has
to do with the author's apparent belief that atheism==evil. Needless to
say, i take great exception to that :)

The class discussion on this was a bit more indepth than i've grown used
to - there were a few interesting comments made on the nature of evil.
At least one classmate initially saw fit to suggest that good intentions
can absolve a person of their evils. I got to
[Godwin](http://www.faqs.org/docs/jargon/G/Godwin's-Law.html) the
discussion at this point, which is something that i haven't had the
pleasure of doing in a live debate in ages :) Mind you, it didn't end
the discussion, either.

All in all, it was an interesting debate. My prof. seemed to read
O'Connor as saying that evil is a choice that we all make, while i saw
Rufus' statement that the Devil was in him as an abrogation of his
ability or willingness to choose, and thus an attempt to absolve himself
of responsibility for his own actions. It's a matter of interpretation,
and i think that my stance has a lot to do with my own atheism - so, for
all those offended by the last posting, YMMV :)

Feel free to respond - for those who wonder, i do read every posting
(they're all mailed to me as they're posted) so i'd love to hear from
you.
