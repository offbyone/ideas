Thanks to the vagaries of this summer's seemingly super-humid weather, I
have the day off today.

W00t!

Now, if only I hadn't had to find out about this at 5:00 AM after
getting up at 4:00 and making my way all the way to the north end of the
city. Oh well, such is life.

So, here's the latest:

Regarding internet access: For some reason that has not been made clear
to me, the generous soul who was loaning me his phone line for internet
use has disconnected me, saying something about "gotta learn the rules"
without further elaboration. As a result, I'm back to incommunicado for
the duration, it seems, unless he's only doing this temporarily.

Regarding work: Work is proceeding apace, keeping me busy and more or
less entertained. Less, I suppose. The weather has been ridiculously hot
for the last few days, and I've been cooking to a slow boil wandering
around on all these black/dark brown surfaces. It's been fun, to a
certain extent, but I could do with temperatures in the area of 20,
instead of 30, degrees.

There's really not a lot else that I can post about. I've been watching
more hockey these past few weeks than I have in years, and I'll admit to
enjoying it. Miranda and I take great amusement from the fairweather
Calgary uber-fans who insist on toting flags and signs around, for the
two weeks that they're going to remain fans. I wonder how many of those
flags are going to find themselves dumpstered next week?

Oh well.

So, perhaps I'll be seeing the new Harry Potter movie today. Depends, I
guess, on whether Simon is in town or not.
