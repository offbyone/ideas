Well...

I just learned how to pack a parachute.

I've jumped from a plane twice in the last five days (yeah, not too
much).

I'm turning in my second assignment of the school year.

I've survived my first ever round of layoffs.

I've got to start my project work.

I'm laying on a couch typing this.

I'm going to eat chili this weekend in the company of geeks.

I'm going to miss Char while she's away this week.

I ate a lot of turkey last night.

I wish I was working full time.
