So, in the Champagne district, we visited both Reims and Epernay. Epernay is the closest to the birthplace of champagne by Dom Perignon, who, once he discovered his masterpiece, apparently (probably quite drunkenly) ran up the streets yelling: *Quick my brothers, come! I'm drinking the stars!* Now, that described it well, me thinks.

We learned a wonderful amount about champagne, about its creation, and how truly different every house is in taste, and in technique, to their ability of course, since the process is so meticulously controlled. And, most importantly, drank a respectable amount of champagne. Mom, if you are reading this: No silly flip flops for me. :)
