I'm looking at the front matter of one of my professors'
[weblog](http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~wcooper/graymatter/index.html),
which closely associates [Che
Guevara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che\_Guevara) with the [Free
Culture](http://www.freeculture.org/) movement.

Does anyone else see anything ironic in that? Rabid communist/socialist
as an icon of Free Culture?

Faugh.
