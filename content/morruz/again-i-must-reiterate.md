I found a slovak cookbook, and I was totally right just by taste how to make that Terchová dish.

Cajmin and I are very proud of ourselves for successfully navigating bus and train systems here where we know no language really, and lafter leaving Praha, there really is no english speaking, unless (according to that school teacher) you talk to kids (and I guess in fairness, some 'youngsters'). We are splitting up today, I think I mentioned that, but just for a day or two.

On our freaking awsome walk, we took a video with my boobycam, which you guys can all see if you don't mind, it's quite funny, we think. To answer your question, Mir, we found the castles with a little of both, we just sort of read about it in LP, but I didn't think it was this close, and then we picked up a local hiking guide and found it in there. I'm sure the pictures won't do it justice, but well, you'll have to come with me if you want to see it. I'm too scared of heights to have seen all of it, but Cajmin got a lot out of it, and I'l lget his pictures as well as mine.

I discovered yesterday that I could have been taking videos this whole time, since I ha(d) room for over 7 hours on my plam pilot, and there were things I would have liked to have videoed, but oh well, memories will have to suffice. Now that I know, though, I can show you some stuff. The boobycam is a little hard to watch since the pixel amt is too small and there is as a result a lot of lag, but you'll get the picture. hehe.
