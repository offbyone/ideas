Okay, now that the initial Yahoo!! is out of the way, here's some actual information on the trip. It's an 11 day cruise on an 80 passenger boat, leaving Usuaia on Feb. 11th and returning on the 22nd. The crossing of the Drake Passage takes two days each way, leaving 5-6 days for visiting the Antarctic Peninsula and surrounding islands. Weather and ice-permitting, we attempt two landings per day, some on the islands and some on the continent. We're supposed to have great chances of seeing several types of penguins, whales, sea lions and birds. Oh, and icebergs. Oh, and glaciers. So for the next couple of weeks any tanning I do will be from reflected sunlight off ice and snow. Oh yeah, what a holiday!

Cost... not for the faint-walleted.

So, since Dad is a pretty sporadic storyteller, and I've been mostly occupied with uploading pictures, here are a few more descriptions of what we've been keeping ourselves busy with. Torres del Paine was great. Really neat terrain, in that the whole trail system is a big circle surrounding a group of amazingly photogenic mountains, with all the hard climbs shooting off towards the center for better views of the rocky peaks. For those of you out there who have attempted rock climbing, the Torres sure look like they'd be a challenge. But people have made it to all of the peaks (between 1958 and 1963). After all that hiking, we decided to take it easy by boarding a (not)luxury cruise-liner (read-cargo ferry) for what was supposed to be a 38hour trip through the Straights of Magellan and the Beagle channel. The extra day we spent in a small enclosed bay waiting out a storm sure seemed like a smart idea when we finally got to Puerto Williams and heard stories about boats caught out in the waves, with one big cruise ship down near Antarctica ending up crashed on rocks and having to evacuate all on board. (don't worry, I'm sure that won't happen to us) After spending a relaxing day in P. Williams (which WE consider to be the southern-most city, not this uppity Ushuaia bullshit though they do have the marketing behind them) we bought passage on another small familly-run boat to get us across the channel to the North (see? not furthest south!) and into Ushuaia. The captain and crew were really friendly, it was nice and personal, especially since we were the only four passengers. Oh yeah, the other two in our group were another father-daughter pair, Kewal and Juhie. They're from the States and have three more weeks to go, part of which they will be spending in Rio during Carnaval. Really great people.

So yeah. That's it for now.
