Well, the next few days are all taken care of. We're really finding that there are some important connections down here that have to be booked ahead, due to a combination of schedules and complications. So there was the missed sailing from Puerto Montt to Puerto Natales due to boat breakdown, then down here on the southern tip, we're finding that either they don't have the sailing route we would like or that they go so infrequently that we really have to match our stays and stops to fit it in. So our stay here in Puerto Natales/Torres del Paine is a bit short so that we can make it back to Punta Arenas on Wednesday to catch the boat from there to Puerto Williams (so many Ps to keep track of!) But we are booked for that sailing. Puerto Williams is on la Isle Navarino, which is just South of Tiera del Fuego.

So the next three days will be spent hiking in the national park, which we're looking forward to. We just met a couple of girls who recently returned from a nice little continent to the south, and they gave us what we hope will be valuable information. I guess we'll see.

So that's what we \*will\* do. As for what we \*have\* done, we visited the Municipal Cemetary in Punta Arenas, which Grandad told me about before we left. The hostel we stayed at in P.Arenas was run by a really friendly and helpful couple, they pointed us in the direction of a great restaurant where we got to try the Chilean delicacy, Curantos (well, I shouldn't say delicacy, it was basically a heaping plate of oh so slow-cooked meat and potatos - no knife necessary). We're trying to put together how to cook it once we get home. Maybe some of you want to be in on that?
