Char informs me that i have an interesting habit. When, as often happens, i fall asleep before she does, apparently when she finally turns off the lights, i tend to roll over and hug her in my sleep, occasionally mumbling something semi-coherent.

Last night, she tells me that i rolled over, wrapped my arms around her, and in a tone that she describes as \"seductive\", i said: \"I want to remove your exponents and solve your equation.\"
