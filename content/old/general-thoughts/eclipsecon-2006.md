So\...

Work, in their infinite generosity, has deigned to send me \-- all expenses paid, no less \-- to [Eclipse Con 2006](http://www.eclipsecon.org/) down in Santa Clara, California. I'm flying out March 19th and back March 24th, and expect to have an amazing time \-- very educational, very enjoyable stuff.

I've been a big fan of [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) for a long time, now. It's a phenomenal development tool that has made it easier and faster to write good Java code. I'm looking forward to learning a whole lot more than I know now about how to maximize our use of it.

Did I mention that I love my job?
