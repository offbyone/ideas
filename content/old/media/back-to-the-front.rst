Although i read it a bit less regularly than some, what with not getting
the paper on a daily basis, one of the only strips that has kept my
interest, through the steady decline of the modern comic page is
Doonesbury. Recognizable characters, interesting plotlines, a viewpoint
that differers from mine... Scratch that last, a \_viewpoint at all\_.
Well, at the start of this week, Trudeau began a `huge
change <http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/dailydose/index.html?uc_full_date=20040419>`__
to one of his longtime characters.

BD without a helmet. It's tough to picture, if you've read the strip for
as long as I have.

I'm officially interested. As, as usual, are
"these":http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/32610 folks.
