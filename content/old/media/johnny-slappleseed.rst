Don't mind the name; it's kind of an inside joke.

So, being typically a couple of days behind the curve on the Daily Show
viewing, I just got around to seeing the episode that aired on 28 Feb,
and it had a "Back in Black" segment that dealt with -- among other
things -- [Daniel Radcliffe](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0705356/)
appearing in [Equus](http://www.equustheplay.com/), which includes a
full-frontal nude scene, and is not a play for the kiddies.

So, some dumb bint on a news program referring to this event trotted out
the same old crap I hear every time any connection -- however tenuous --
is made between the world of media for children and things that adults
are ostensibly capable of understanding: "her young son saw these
pictures televised, and he was really confused. Isn't there a danger
here?"

My response: Stop Breeding.

Seriously, just bloody \_stop\_, already. If the mechanics of
reproduction are confusing and dangerous, \_stop using them\_. We don't
want more of that bloody attitude anyway, and really, you're probably
too insecure to be good in bed anyway. Here's a tip, though: If the idea
of an actor stepping outside of \_your\_ comfort zone is \_dangerous\_,
you need to grow the fuck up. I can't emphasize this enough.

God damn, this angers me. Your confusion, you pathetic excuses for
parents and human beings, should not be projected onto your children,
whose only confusion comes from wondering why their parents are all
flustered whenever they ask about any part of their bodies in between
the tops of their thighs and their navels.

Grr.

Okay, I'm just being incoherent here. I'll stop now.
