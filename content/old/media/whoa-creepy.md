Courtesy of the ever-loving [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/31501) comes a bunch of [scary-looking mother(---)s](http://www.comp.utas.edu.au/students-nhm/baina/auv/fish/) for you to ogle and quiver at.

Man, i SO want to watch more Discovery Channel now... Which reminds me, Char and i have yet to get around to watching the [Elegant Universe](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/program.html) that i collected a little while back. It looks really nifty, too.
