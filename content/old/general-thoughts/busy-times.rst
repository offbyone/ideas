Well, it's been a busy few weeks here, as evinced by... well, nought, as
far as you all can tell. I've been lazy with regards to all \_kinds\_ of
aspects of communication, and it shows. Sometimes, I am amazed that
anyone even pays attention.

So, here's a summary (I do this more than I should, I think).

1. I've finally got my own computer back again. Although it's been a
frustrating month (All of September) with no personal computer, on Oct 1
I received the aforementioned shiny new Macbook Pro 17". This thing is a
titan among computers, easily being usable as a TV too :) I'm much
pleased with it.

2. In connection with the above-mentioned computer acquisition, I should
be looking at updating some plugins I've got out in the wild; I've been
meaning to for ages, but because I've been without a computer for what
feels like forever, it hasn't happened.

3. In what can only be called an embarrassment of riches, on the same
day I received the new MBP I also received my work laptop, which is well
on its way to being an adequate replacement for my work desktop.
Shockingly all of it works, except for the goddamned wireless, rendering
it more or less 100% tethered at home. More to come, there.

4. I finished Neal Stephenson's "Baroque Cycle", a 3000-page epic set in
the years preceding the enlightenment and telling a very interesting
(fictional) story about the lives of Newton, Leibniz, and some fictional
people of the time. It took me ages to read, but it was \_so\_ worth it.

5. I'm at 37 jumps now, only one injury!

6. I should get to work.

7. Bioshock kicks my ass eight ways from Sunday. I am so pleased with
it, and am \*\*so\*\* going to try a replay.
