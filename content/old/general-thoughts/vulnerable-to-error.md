It's pretty galling to see the simple mistakes that can creep up on one in otherwise basic maths. It's not that i don't know how to do things, rather, i forget little details and it costs me dearly in terms of marks.

I'm getting back my Math 125 midterm as i write this, and i'm betting that my mark is not going to be as good as i had hoped. There's at least two basic problems that i can already tell that i messed up. And i messed up in a simple, simple way on both of them. It's called *reading the damned question!*

Bah

So, onward and outward. Gotta get this shit together and stop messing up the small stuff.

On happier note, my CMPT201 app - which has been driving me mad for a week - is now at v1.0, full working. At least, as far as i can tell.

w00t!

**Update**, minutes later\...

Well, i spoke too soon. My flaws were only in the first two questions, and not as critical as i had thought. I can tolerate a 94% mark :)
