At the time that this all happened, I had not yet started writing my
personal weblog, nor had I really considered it. It's probably a good
thing, since I would most likely have posted the same things that every
other blogger in the world was, and added nothing to the discussion.

Spurred by a [discussion](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/34470) on
Metafilter, though, I checked out something that \_was\_ said then:
[This](http://www.comedycentral.com/tv\_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/dailyshow\_sept11.jhtml)
speech (of sorts) by Jon Stewart (also known to some as
[Char's](http://www.livejournal.com/users/xraystar/) secret lover).

Good bit. Check out the video clip of it -- it's worth it.
