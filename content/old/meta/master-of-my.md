Woohoo!

Well, i hope that this has propagated to all the corners of the web. If it has, then you\'re seeing this - the very first post i\'ve ever had at my very own website!

So, there\'s a few notable changes here. First is the obvious, the new domain name. There\'s an email address at this domain as well for reaching me, it\'s chris at (domain) \... (yes, i\'m still paranoid about spam harvesters\... you should be too!)

Second, .. uh..

Okay, one change only. Perhaps i\'ll post more, who can say? All i do know is that this site is now hosted on a server that knows what they\'re doing. This is a good, good thing.
