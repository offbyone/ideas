I had the last of my final exams today, or more to the point the last two.

I also have received tentative marks for the other three courses --which is just amazingly fast, in my opinion. I really didn't expect to get them back so soon, although at this point I'm not sure whether they translate into an A or a B in their respective courses. The curve, frankly, sucks.

However, in terms of good news, the exam this afternoon, the last of year three, semester one, was the one I was most concerned about, and the one that I felt woefully underprepared for up until I sat down and took the exam. As I read it over, I realized that yes, I _do_ understand this stuff! It was a great feeling. I'm pretty confident that I did well enough on the exam to rate a high mark for it, and by extension the course.

In other news: Not much, really. I was going to link to a plugin that I wrote for my [bittorrent](<http://bittorrent.com/>) client, [Azureus](<http://azureus.sourceforge.net/>), but the wiki that I linked to it from is gone now, along with the description\... However, something vaguely like the description can be found [here]([http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1195811&forum_id=377614](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1195811&forum_id=377614)), and the plugin itself can be gotten [here](/plugins/azautostop0_1.zip), if it interests you. It was quick, dirty, and it does work, but it's not perfect. I'm working on v1.0 as we speak :)
