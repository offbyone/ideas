We leave Ushuaia later today by plane for El Calafate to hike and see glaciars, as if we didn't see lots down south. Basically, it's all north from here on. One thing to remember if you ever do a similar trip, Ushuaia can be troublesome to get out of, try arrange your exit ahead of time as we did. Some people get stuck here for days or have to chose a different direction of exit then they planned.  
The staff on the boat were fantastic. Our fellow passengers were great to spend time with, lots of friendships were started. We have a destination in Bogata and already Morris has intimated that we might be able to squeek in a trip next year before Russia. They, Diego and Ingrid, might come up and visit us first, you would all enjoy them. Simon, I have someone to visit in Moscow too.  
Other than that, I just can't remember all the details now so updates will be ongoing.
