Well, I can\'t say that this past weekend was a terrific one.

Oh, the details were mostly good. I had a good trip with Char, during which she either slept or was happy to chat with me continuously about a whole host of interesting things (PolySci == good conversation). However, the details \-- from some social awkwardness at the wedding itself (on my part, sadly) to some bad news from home (ask Char; it\'s her story to tell) meant that the trip turned out to be less happy than I\'d hoped.

I wish it had been more cheery, but I suppose I still enjoyed the trip; the company was excellent, and even if the details were bad it doesn\'t mean that there was no value in it.
