We are done the deep history part of the tour, having gone to the valley of the kings this morning. I would really stress that to do this tour in summer would be insane both for crowds and temperatures. Had a great donkey ride to the valley, my donkey kept trying to lead the way even if I was hauling back on the reins. There really is some outstanding preserved stuff to be seen here but if one is interested it would be best to take more time and maybe small private tours.  
The locals are friendly, just watch out because they want baksheesh for anything or nothing.  
We take an overnight train back to Cairo tonight, hopefully this ones bathroom was cleaned in the last year or so.  
Extremely lush country and farm land immediate to the nile with absolute desert outside of irrigation.  
Just to let you know, so far I have not found a computer that will allow photo downloads, I may already have quite a bunch.
