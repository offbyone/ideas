As all you reader-like folks recall, we've had some nasty weather of late, culminating in the flooding of our lovely home's basement.

Well, the upshot of that is that at present our house smells of mildew from top to bottom.

Anyone out there know of any way to clear up an odour like that? I'd be grateful for the help, especially since the alternative is for our landlord to replace the carpet and drywall in the basement.
