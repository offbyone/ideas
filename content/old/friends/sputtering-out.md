It\'s been a very sociable week, and while I\'ve enjoyed each and every *single* one of the visits I\'ve had (Yep, [Matt](http://www.offlineblog.com/mildillson/) and [Amy](http://lashingtail.blogspot.com/), that means you don\'t have to feel guilty about anything \-- that\'s the highlight of the week, so far. Glad you liked the new toy!) but I am *so* goddamned tired at this point \-- I\'m loving seeing people that I don\'t get to see often enough, but the strain of being sociable so much in so short of a time is just\... too much.

I look forward to the weekend, because to a greater or lesser extent, my family kind of understands my need to just\... hide, sometimes. It\'ll be great. I\'m bringing a huge pile of books (thanks again, Amy!).

On the \"other parts of life\" front\... Nope, nothing. My job rocks, and that\'s about it.
