Well, that was the hardest exam i have ever had the\... \_privilege\_ \... of taking.

Ew

Oh, it\'s not like it wasn\'t stuff we covered in class, because we \_did\_ cover it, but as soon as i sat down to do it, all of the material drained out of my head like coffee from a cheap paper cup. It was sad.

And a bit humbling, too. I know i\'m overconfident sometimes, but it never really registers til something like this walks up and kicks me in the face. I feel like i don\'t know a damned thing, and i hate it.

Yeah, i know, i say this every time something trips me up. You\'d think i\'d get the idea. The problem is, i usually \_am\_ nearly as good as i think i am. It isn\'t conducive to humility.
