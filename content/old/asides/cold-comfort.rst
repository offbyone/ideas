It's the end of 2007, and last night I was asked by our waitress if I
was "ready for 2008."

It's an interesting question, isn't it? In the absence of epic new plans
for the coming year what does "ready" mean? I'm not panicked about the
coming year, if that's what she meant. I'm not planning to do anything
for which I am not ready, too.

This bit was, of course, a bit of a non sequitur.

Basically, I want to wish everyone that reads this a happy new year. Be
well, be happy. Hopefully your coming year is as good as my previous
one.
