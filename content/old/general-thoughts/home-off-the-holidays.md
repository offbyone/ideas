I'm back in town for a bit of work now. For at least the next couple of days I'll be working locally, which means home at night and relatively short trips to work (for me. You don't want to ask Miranda how _she_ feels about it, let me tell you!)

So, the plus of this is that I'll actually have a bit of a life. The minus is, I'll not be pulling in LOA, which means \$60/day less in income.

You win some, you lose some. Bummer.

Heh. Actually, I'm pretty happy with that. It'll be brief, but pleasant.
