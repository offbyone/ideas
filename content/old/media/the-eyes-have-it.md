Here's one following up on my concerns about [digital image manipulation](http://homepage.mac.com/gapodaca/digital/digital.html).

The gist of it seems to be the small differences - not one of them seemingly significant in and of itself - that add up to create a far different impression on the viewer.

And this power is, well, in the hands of every kiddie that ever downloaded photoshop.

This is scary.
