I just took the time \-- thanks to the wonders of this Interweb thingie \-- to watch the official theatrical trailer for Star Wars episode III.

It looks \_good\_.

\_Really\_ good.

My inner geek \-- You know, the one that dominates pretty much everything I do? \-- is just about creaming his jeans. First, this one is rated PG-13 (or so I hear) and second, it looks like they actually may have wrung some acting out of the young Mr. Christensen.

I\'m not going to rant about it here, anyway. I have, however, decided to see it.
