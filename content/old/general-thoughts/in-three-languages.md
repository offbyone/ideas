Well, not so much. But I really do have nothing to say.

A quick sum-up:

Work: Active, rewarding, and busy.
Friends: Hanging out with a bit more, which is good.
School: Really iffy on Philosophy 250 -- this is some wonky stuff, if you ask me.

The world: Fucked, man. Hypocrisy in Congress down south, media shutdown up here...

I'd rather not think about it.
