Well, there's a couple of less-than-pleasant "things-falling-apart"
issues in my life at the moment. Nothing too serious, they're all
material goods as opposed to the more valuable social and emotional
connections.

First, it seems that some dumb yokel wandering through our back alley
sometime in the last week saw fit to smash the back window of my truck.
It's held together mainly by virtue of the tint film that was on it.
[Simon](http://vernondalhart.livejournal.com) and Mel noticed it and
brought it to my attention yesterday. Bunch of savages in this town, I
kid you not.

Second, the beast is misbehaving. My computer is beginning to experience
hard crashes (lockups bad enough that I have to reboot the old-fashioned
way and my registry is getting corrupted. If that's greek (geek?) to
you, don't worry. Translate it as "BAD" and you'll do okay) and that
annoying hard drive failure issue... I fear that I'm going to have to
accelerate my replacement plans, but I'm going to hold off in the hopes
that it won't be necessary. /me is crossing his fingers with great hope.
