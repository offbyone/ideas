Well, not compared to the heavy stretches of last semester\... But I have been at work late every day I could this week, unless something else kept me away.

I've been making a lot of progress, and right now I'm mucking around in the guts of one of the more complex components we use. Something that is, apparently, not production-ready at all, but is rather getting its maiden voyage (or close to it \-- I'm a bit fuzzy on the particulars) in the code that I'm working on.

Let me tell you, it's interesting stuff, if\... challenging.
