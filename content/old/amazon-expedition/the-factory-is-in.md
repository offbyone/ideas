C and I have landed in our new place. It\'s an older place in an older neighborhood, and holy shit do we have lots of stuff. It\'s especially obvious when it\'s all packed into a house that\'s a bit smaller than we started with.

So, the layout is sweet, in my opinion. It\'s got a tiny kitchen, though, which is likely not to thrill \@DarwinsMom. For now, though, it\'s home. Darwin\'s room is just bloody adorable. I\'d take pictures, but he\'s sleeping like, well, a baby. Another time, perhaps.

Right now, Char and I are chilling out with some local beer (Red Hook IPA \-- Char considers it a pale shadow of a good Lagunitas) and Netflix.
