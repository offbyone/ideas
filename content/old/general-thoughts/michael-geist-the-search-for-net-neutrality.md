Found on the net: [The Search for Net Neutrality](http://www.michaelgeist.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1040)

Meaning, of course, that we're still looking for it. It seems, and I've run into this issue myself over the last few months, that our wonderful ISP overlords have decided to quietly engage strict controls on the *nature* of the content that we will be allowed to get over their wires\... You know, the ones you pay to use?

Read the article. And, if anyone knows of any way to derail this --legislative action, consumer agitation -- I'd love to know. I'm not interested in ineffective protests or street marches -- this is the *internet*, not Vietnam. But I'd like to make some kind of difference, here.

This has also been discussed on [/.](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/19/1524200&tid=95&tid=17), which should surprise nobody.
