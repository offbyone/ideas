I don't normally toot my family's horn in this space (they're as gifted as I am at that themselves, for the most part) but my Granddad is [widely regarded as a great man](http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=d2b99fc9-f7c6-4370-ae5b-769bd2055016&k=38593).

I'm sure that [Char](http://xraystar.livejournal.com/) will comment on this soon enough.
