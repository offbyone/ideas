Sorta.

I spent the last week tearing into a fairly complex piece of old code,
digging out some poor design decisions and cleaning up the legacy of
student programmers past. It was... terrifying.

But I've survived, and the world is a better place for it.

If anyone noticed that I was a bit distant and distracted in the last
week, though, that was why.
