Well, the vacation thing I mentioned is this:

Two days ago, there was a general announcement that the coming long weekend would be three days off for the whole crew \-- lock, stock and barrel we were shutting down to get some required time off.

Yesterday, Ron, the owner of the company, called up from California, called the job foreman a \"lame fuck\" and decreed that the shutdown not occur.

So\... After how many people made plans?

Anyway, I just said \"Sorry, already have plans. Can\'t cancel. Have a nice weekend! ;) \"

So I\'ll be in E-town from friday this week to tuesday AM.

Party at my place saturday! Everyone is invited!
