It's been a bit since my last update, much to my chagrin. Sorry, folks,
I'll try to keep on the ball.

So, here's the rundown:

I went skydiving last weekend, did another AFF(Advanced Free Fall)
training jump, this one having to do with making myself fall faster and
move forward. It was amazing. As always. A couple of fellow geeks came
out too, and a good time was had by all.

I got all of my marks back. I was leery of posting these, because in one
case I'm not too proud of it. However, here they are:

| \* Cmput 391: B (This is the lowest mark I've ever gotten in a CS
  course, and the one of which I am un-proud)
| \* Cmput 325: B+ (This is the second-lowest. Not too happy about it,
  either)
| \* Cmput 301: A+ (This one really doesn't surprise me all that much. I
  kicked that course's ass. It was fun, too. 96% overall mark)
| \* Cmput 340: A

That last one doesn't seem like it belongs in that order, does it?
Except when you take into account the \_nature\_ of the course. Cmput340
is a numerical methods course. It's probably one of the harder courses,
in terms of theory and understanding, that I've ever taken. The class
average for the course was 67.3%, just to give you an idea. My mark,
however, was \_87.6%\_. I couldn't possibly be more proud. The course
was hard, required a lot of work, and taught me a lot. And I kicked its
ass. It's one of the marks of which I am most proud, right alongside the
Cmput366 mark from last semester, which was just as surprisingly high.

Work is going well. I'm actively contributing to the big project we're
working on, putting together snippets of code for a tools library. It's
satisfying, sometimes. Other times it feels like I know Nothing At All
about the job, and am going to demonstrate my incompetence in some
hyperdramatic fashion. Still, it's mostly good.

How do you all like \_this\_ look for the site? After Char commented
about some difficulties commenting with the pinup layout, I moved over
to this. I like it decently, although I can think of a few tweaks I'd
like to make. Maybe later...

Also, re: politics: Fuck 'em. Let's nuke 'em from orbit; it's the only
way to be sure.
