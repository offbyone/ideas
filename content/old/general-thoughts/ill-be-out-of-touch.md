For the next couple of days, I\'ll be \... difficult to reach.

The usual e-mail will get to me, but not necessarily as fast, and in the evenings\... Nothing. I\'ll be internet-less until the 11th, which sucks the big one, but at least I can get my mail at work.

It turns out we have a short window to have both the moving truck and the elevator at the new location. As a consequence, we\'re going to be doing a crash-packing of the truck starting at about 1 PM, when I get it to the house, and trying to get \_everything\_ into the new place by 4 PM, when we have to give up the elevator. Needless to say, it\'ll be a challenge. So, if anyone reading this can make it, and knows where we live, and wants to lend a hand, do. Please. However, I won\'t read it on here \-- right after this, I\'m taking down the desk, and the computer\...

So \... Thanks, in advance, to the helpers. The usual Pizza + Beer payout applies, of course.
