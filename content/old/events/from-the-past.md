At the time that this all happened, I had not yet started writing my personal weblog, nor had I really considered it. It's probably a good thing, since I would most likely have posted the same things that every other blogger in the world was, and added nothing to the discussion.

Spurred by a [discussion](<http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/34470>) on Metafilter, though, I checked out something that _was_ said then: [This]([http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/dailyshow_sept11.jhtml](http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/dailyshow_sept11.jhtml)) speech (of sorts) by Jon Stewart (also known to some as [Char's](<http://www.livejournal.com/users/xraystar/>) secret lover).

Good bit. Check out the video clip of it -- it's worth it.
