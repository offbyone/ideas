Convocation is coming up in a very short time, and I'm pretty pumped about it. It marks the end of a long, long road, one that should have been shorter than it was. Better late than never is my motto at this point.

Mindless Self-Indulgence (a more fitting band name I cannot imagine) is playing this tuesday, and I'm gonna go see them with a whole horde of friends. I expect bruising, which will be fun.

France is coming closer. There might be some more news there, too, but I'm not 100% (98%?) sure of it.

Simon is kindly sending us to an opera! We'll be seeing the Flying Dutchman, which is probably going to be really odd. I've never been to an opera, so I hope that they don't have a dress code :)
