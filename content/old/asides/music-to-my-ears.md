If you're at all into post-rock (pretentious wankery, in other words), [Thee Silver Mt. Zionist](http://www.livejournal.com/users/charlatantric/) is a good little blog to check out. Very pleasant, nice-sounding music along the lines of Godspeed! You Black Emperor and Sigur Ros.

Well, some of it is.

Anyway, neat noise. I recommend it.
