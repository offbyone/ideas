Hey, all you craaaazy...

Okay, that is definitely not _my_ tone, there.

Seriously, though, what are all of you up to? I know [Matt](http://www.offlineblog.com/mildillson) is done for the summer, but of course is swamped with lesson planning for the heavy [workload](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workload) of next year. Another sometime reader has just [gotten](http://www.asylus.com/2005/07/engaged.html) [engaged](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement), which is cool news, and Mom is settling in at home. The usual suspects, etc...

But (what with moving) the only one of you I've really seen a lot of this [summer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt) is [Simon](http://vernondalhart.livejournal.com/), who -- while cool, and all -- is only a small part of my circle of valued friends.

We're almost set here to host some sort of get-together, and I intend to invite everyone that reads this (and a few that don't, those technologically-[backward](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite "Those wacky loom-wreckers!") people who for some reason think I'm a decent sort). Dates will be forthcoming. Apparently [Char](http://xraystar.livejournal.com) is drooling over the idea of hosting a [cocktail party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party) :)
