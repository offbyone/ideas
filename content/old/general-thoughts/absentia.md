I apologize in advance for the fact that I will be ridiculously out of touch for the next three weeks.

I have a workload consisting of two projects and four large assignments, plus preparation for final exams, all within three weeks. It\'s a quirk of scheduling, but a quirk that is going to beat me into the ground.

Amusingly, I had just planned on trying to kick the coffee habit. I think that\'s going to have to wait, now.

So, in advance, I miss all of you!
