Although it will no doubt come as a surprise to some (all?) of my
readers, I haven't been giving too much thought to my upcoming birthday,
and all that goes with that. Meaning, of course, the greedy part of it
-- gifts.

Yes, yes, i know... Putting a post about it up on the blog certainly
doesn't strengthen my claim, does it?

Well, bugger that. It so happens that, this year, I am more or less at a
loss as to what I even want for a gift. The fact of the matter is, ever
since Dad got me one of [these](http://www.apple.com/ipod/) for
Christmas, well, i literally haven't \_wanted\_ any gadgetry. Oh, sure,
I want to upgrade my computer, but the day \_that\_ stops, it's time to
bury me. But, other than that I haven't wanted toys. It's kind of weird.
And, as a result, I've been less focused on my materialistic side as
I've simply reveled in the pleasure of carrying 1900 songs with me
wherever I go.

But, since I've been pounding away at a few things here as programming
projects of my own, I've come to realize that there are a few, slightly
oddball (as in, they get buried in the Amazon wishlist) items i'd like.
And, as usual, they're all books.

If you are thinking of getting me a book for the b-day, read the
extended entry for it. `O'Reilly's JavaServer
Pages <http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596005636/qid=1082266289/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_2_1/702-5114952-4034416>`__
or alternately, `Manning publishing's Web Development with JavaServer
Pages <http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/193011012X/qid=1082266397/sr=1-17/ref=sr_1_0_17/702-5114952-4034416>`__

`Core J2EE Patterns: Best Practices and Design
Strategies <http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131422464/ref=lm_lb_1/702-5114952-4034416>`__

There are no doubt more like these, but these ones really appeal to me.
And they're right up the alley of the project i'm going to work on this
summer in my spare time. Which I'll talk about in another posting.
