My god\... Apparently the powers that be at new line cinema have decided to grant my fondest wish about LOTR: [Theatrical, all-day marathon](http://www.lordoftherings.net/trilogy/index.html) of the *extended versions* of the first two movies, followed immediately by the first screening of The Return of the King.

Only downside? No theatres in Edmonton on that list yet\... Who wants to start lobbying with me? I\'m **so** all over that!
