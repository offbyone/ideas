This is a bit of an informal poll to see what style for the site you readers like best. Please, check them all out (in the drop box to the right/left) and let me know which one works nicest for you. Once I've been told which it is, I'll be switching to just one stylesheet so that I can play around with it a bit more and make some changes to the main index if I want to.

I want comments, damn it!! ;)
