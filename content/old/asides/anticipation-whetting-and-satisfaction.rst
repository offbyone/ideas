A: Looking forward to a good game of hockey tonight, good hamburgers,
and good company.

W: Found a nifty site called `Luxist <http://www.luxist.com/>`__ that
blogs the *things* of the rich and famous. I smack my lips in
consumerist glee at some of them, and shake my head in vague discomfort
at others.

S: Against all odds, my iPod works again!

If you could see me, I couldn't claim to be dancing a merry jig. Since
you can't, I am.
