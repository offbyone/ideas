... and its polar opposite, of course. Because, if I were inspired at
the moment, I'd be out \_creating something\_, as opposed to sitting
here polishing up my mail server and posting this.

I'm looking at at least three programming projects that actively
interest me right now. And yet, I can't bring myself to work on any of
them. Nothing seems to make sense with any of them, they're just lines
on a screen these days. I know that there's more there, but every single
little snag seems insurmountable in this mood, and programming is all
about overcoming the little snags, one at a time.

And nothing else is any better. As a sample of my attention span right
now, I'm reading \_The Neverending Story\_ (sporadically), \_The Diamond
Age\_ (almost done), the Chanur series, the Dark is Rising series,
\_Applied Cryptography\_, and \_A New Kind of Science\_. And I'm playing
both Neverwinter Nights and Doom 3. I don't have the mental tenacity of
a peanut right now, and it's getting me down.
