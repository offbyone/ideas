Here's more help for anyone suffering growing pains using the new range of browsers:

If you get strange error messages clicking on links from places like Outlook while using FireFox to browse, "this":http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2004/06/18-186.html may be the solution for you.

One potential serious flaw in FireFox is detailed [here](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1621463,00.asp) and its fix is [here](http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=154). It's a nasty one, but it's still easy enough to fix and it's not likely to be a problem for you. (Info on this one via [Don Park](http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=33fc27a0-a44e-45db-8d2c-47ec3f84ee74))

I have added easy links down the sidebar to get these two programs, but here are pretty picture links for the moment:

| FireFox: [![Get Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/buttons/takebacktheweb_large.png){width="185px" height="72px"}](http://getfirefox.com/)
| Thunderbird: [![Get Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/buttons/reclaimyourinbox_large.png){width="185px" height="105px"}](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/)
