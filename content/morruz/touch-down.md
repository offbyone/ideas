And game.

We're home, now, and it's good to be back with the kitties. All told, I had a great time, and I've already got a few things I'd like to do when I go back. I want to see Tokyo *without* a guide (sorry, Jamie, but I love the freedom to just... wander. Like you ;) ), perhaps see Nagano and/or Kyoto. Hiroshima is a plausible return destination, too.

Anyway, I've slept now, and now I'm gonna lay about the house and detune until I can swing by work to pick up a shipment that was delivered there for me.

Further postings by me will be made over at my main site.
