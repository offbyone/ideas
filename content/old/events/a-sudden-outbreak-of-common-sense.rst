Well, well.

Persuant to my [post about the Canadian
DMCA](/backlog/2007/12/08/rights-you-dont-want-those/) it appears that
the [legislation has been
pulled](http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2459/1/) and will not be
enacted in its current form.

It's hard to say why without the power of telepathy, but I would imagine
that the widespread public outcry over the effects of the law can't have
hurt.

Sorry, the bill has been *delayed*, not withdrawn
