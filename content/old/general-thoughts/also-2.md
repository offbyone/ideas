At last, our phone was hooked up today. Net cost to [Char](http://xraystar.livejournal.com) and I? \$0.

Apparently the previous owners of the house (or the last Telus repairman in here) decided that since there was only one line anyway, why not just disconnect the other one completely? Seemed logical at the time, I guess.

Wankers.

Anyway, our number hasn't changed. And now, it works!
