Well, Carcassonne was pretty impressive. It's majesty and beauty was only superceded by my desire to be home, so I truly did not do it justice. The History surrounding its existence is, as Michael can attest to is fascinating, but I didn't go too deep into it because of how tired I was. Truly, I did not do it justice. Chris' lessons on medievil warfare and fortification were fascinating while standing between the walls and imagining what it was like.

The town is just newly touristy, since The fortified "La Cite" of Carcassonne has just recently become a UNESCO world heritage site, so the place is still small and rough around the edges, with a strong Accented Langue D'Oc (which is southern France "french") And a strong Spanish resemblance creeping into the faces of all the men. Well, the women might have been, too, but I never noticed. All of our service was quirky and pleasant, and our hosts were wonderful Brits who spoke very little French. We had the opportunity to meet some new people: since we wre in a guest house, we had breakfast with our "flatmates" which is always a nice way to start a day.
