So, back to the classes. I\'ve now attended each and every one of my classes for this semester, and one thing strikes me:

It\'s disappointing how few people have failed the first year.

There are several people whose coursework last year consisted simply of downloading a java disassembler and reverse-engineering the lab samples, and then playing a whackload of Counterstrike. Depressing. And this is the future of the science\...

So, the rundown, as is obligatory:

CMPT201: C++. Yay! Major source of moron attrition number 1. Ron\'s not too lenient, which i like. And, he\'s running the labs. This i like even more.

CMPT229: Assembler. This is likely to be the other heavy attrition course\... I hope.

MATH125: Linear Algebra (advanced) \... Solomonovich. Need i say more?

STAT221: Dunno yet, but the teacher (this is for you, Char) has an irish accent. Wanna come to girlfriend/teacher night? :)

PSYC104: Required for Cognitive Psych. Otherwise, looks like a great time to take a nap.

Anyway, i\'m hoping to get a nice view of some of the lazier students crashing and burning\... w00t!
