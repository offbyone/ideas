I took some pictures from the plane as we flew into Punta Arenas, they turned out pretty well, I think. And uploading to the new and improved gallery is really quite easy, and doesn't take too long, so hopefully I'll be able to do it regularly. We're enjoying the south, but it's not quite as warm here. If you check the photo gallery, you'll see that even Dad is wearing pants!

Crazy!
