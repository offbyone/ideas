Just finished going over a short story in ENGL-101 today called "The Lame Shall Enter First" and - whoah - did this story ever leave me feeling, well, strongly. So, the story is basically about - in terms of subject - the failure of a father to pay attention to his son, and the son's response. There's a lot going on here, though, and a lot of it has to do with the author's apparent belief that atheism==evil. Needless to say, i take great exception to that :)

The class discussion on this was a bit more indepth than i've grown used to - there were a few interesting comments made on the nature of evil. At least one classmate initially saw fit to suggest that good intentions can absolve a person of their evils. I got to \[Godwin\](<http://www.faqs.org/docs/jargon/G/Godwin's-Law.html>) the discussion at this point, which is something that i haven't had the pleasure of doing in a live debate in ages :) Mind you, it didn't end the discussion, either.

All in all, it was an interesting debate. My prof. seemed to read O'Connor as saying that evil is a choice that we all make, while i saw Rufus' statement that the Devil was in him as an abrogation of his ability or willingness to choose, and thus an attempt to absolve himself of responsibility for his own actions. It's a matter of interpretation, and i think that my stance has a lot to do with my own atheism - so, for all those offended by the last posting, YMMV :)

Feel free to respond - for those who wonder, i do read every posting (they're all mailed to me as they're posted) so i'd love to hear from you.
