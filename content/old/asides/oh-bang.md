There was some fantastic lightning last night, for those who were either asleep or not in my area.

So, being a thunder nerd, I slept on the balcony. Very, very nice.

Not a lot, as usual, to report. I've been building nifty things at work, as we bring our product up to a new Alpha release. I've been grinding away at the details, hacking ODBC code to work with Oracle, planning new extensions to the product. It's a satisfying process.

In other news, I have not had a chance to jump this weekend. Sadness.
