Does that mean we *want* them to come back?

If you're not sure what I mean, I'm referring to the `travels of my
father and sister <http://www.offlineblog.com/morruz/>`__, whom I have
entreated to provide a web-based journal of their experiences.
(`Matt <http://www.offlineblog.com/mildillson/>`__, can you vet. that
last sentence for structural correctness? I got fancy, and it seems
subtly wrong, somehow).

Anyway, the site is hosted beside this one, and is named
`Morruz <http://www.offlineblog.com/morruz/>`__. Clicky on any of the
obvious links in this post to get there. In the instance that links are
not clear (the style of my page doesn't do a good job of highlighting
them, a shortcoming that I plan to rectify One Of These Days) then...
well, hunt.
