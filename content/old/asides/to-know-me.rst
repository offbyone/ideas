Yeah, or something like that, anyway.

It's increasingly obvious to me that I need to find something that I'm
passionate about to write about. The "Here's what's new in my life"
format has its place, and will never truly leave these pages, but I
don't know that it has the mileage to make it.

At any rate, this is more of a "ping" to let you all know I'm not dead,
I haven't forgotten the blog, and I plan to write more, soon.

Oh...

And Apple just released a mechanism whereby my MacBook will be able to
run Windows. Games, games, games!

Heh. That one was for Char.
