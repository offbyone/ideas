I've had cause to password-protect a post for the first time since I started this blog, and I thought I'd make a note so that you dedicated (five) readers can get in.

Just email me and ask, I'll hook you up with the password. It'll vary for each post that I protect, so don't expect the one from this post to carry over. If the post is one which I wish to share with you, I'll send it to you. If not, please do not be offended. Seriously. I don't know how to make sure you're not, so I'll just tell you not to be :)
