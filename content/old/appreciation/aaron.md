Moving right along\...

This is where it gets a bit more complicated. Most of the people I'm going to be writing about in this vein now are people who read the blog with varying degrees of frequency. I'm not really sure how I feel about talking about them in such a public forum, and more to the point, I'm not sure how comfortable _they_ are with it.

That being said, nobody I really hate is gonna end up in this section of the site :)

Anyway, here's one for Aaron

I wouldn't be far short of the truth calling Aaron my muse. Not the only one, to be sure, but somehow talking to him and getting a picture of what he's doing in the myriad topics where our interests overlap always prods me to pursue those more actively myself. Maybe less of a muse, more of an inspiration. He's really damn good at what he does, and he gives me hope that maybe I'm not so hopeless either.

A sense of humour. Really, I'd try to describe it, but I'd have to have a better gift with images and words. Suffice it to say he's entertaining.

Aaron is one of the class of friends that I have that I wish I saw more of. Due to a combination of my own limited social energy and time, not to mention his numerous interests and work, I see him far too rarely for the enjoyment I get out of the visits. This isn't limited just to him, there's a fair number of friends that I find this happens with, and I think I'm lessened by it. I hope to remedy this, but then I've hoped to remedy it for years in many instances. I don't have a lot of hope of success.

I guess one last thing -- I owe Aaron a huge debt of gratitude (and dinner! Let us not forget dinner!) for helping me out when the basement flooded. Since I was phoning in order of proximity, he came up relatively early, and took time out of his own plans to help out.

What more can a guy ask for in a friend?
