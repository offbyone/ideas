Last morning in Africa, in 24 hours I'll be trying to find simon and Jennie.  
Although we were here in the rainy season we barely saw any rain just a few showers. Lots of heat and sun as we were basically directly under the sun at noon.  
The finishing two days of this trip were anti-climactic but nothing can erase what the rest was like. Our group is disbanding as we head to different destinations to continue trips or lives.  
Now, I putter away a day, have a few Tuskers and off I go. See you all soon, Michael
