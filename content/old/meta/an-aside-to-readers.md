If you happen to be a reader of either of this site\'s child blogs, Morruz or MildIllSon, they\'re sort of moved now.

Oh, the content already moved, but the blogs themselves are best reached at a slightly different address:

Where, before, there was \"http://www.offlineblog.com/morruz\" and \"http://www.offlineblog.com/mildillson\", now there are \"http://morruz.offlineblog.com/\" and \"http://mildillson.offlineblog.com\". The sidebar links are updated, and feel free to head over there at your convenience, although [somebody](http://mildillson.offlineblog.com/) doesn\'t update often enough, and [another somebody](http://morruz.offlineblog.com/) isn\'t traveling at the moment. Still, it bore mentioning.

In addition, I\'m trying to convince Beau to upload something of his own to the web. This something will NOT be work-safe, which should surprise nobody who knows Beau, and might well be offensive to some, if I\'m lucky.
