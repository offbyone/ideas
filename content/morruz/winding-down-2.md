Well,　the week is almost up, and I\*ve been shopping like crazy, although I think I\*m all shopped out :) There are a few more things I would like to check out, but otherwise I think I am done. We\*ve had an excellent time, I think 10 days in this country at a time is enough, it is so ADD, and I\*m not so good with that.

The city of Tokyo is really like a collection of cities in the same space, so there is realy different XP every time you get off the train, which is really cool, but unfourtunately it leads to taking lots of trains everywhere. I kind of like to stay within walking distance to my hostel, but you just can\*t do that here. Seriously, though, what a fantastic place!

We\*ve gone spooky shopping, (I\*ve got so many wierd things with skulls on them) sock shopping (there is a real thing about knee highs here) seen a cosplay park, japanese dudes who have a rock-a-billie (pardon the spelling) exhibition in a park that gets enough exposure that there is a whole host of vendor set up to feed onlookers, dudes dressed as dolls, dolls dressed as dudes, SLAYER KAREOKE, the most beautiful coloring books I have ever set eyes upon (I can\*t wait to break out the pencil crayons). I don\*t think that it is possible to remember all I\*ve seen this weekend to write it down in this short period.

But it\*s really not all wild and crazy. I\*ve also gone to the Tokyo museum which houses some beautiful art and Japanese Historical aritfacts, seen some beautiful parks, and drank GOOD coffee in a 1L bottle from the refrigerated section of the Sebun-Erebun.

I am certainly going to miss the heated vending machines, warmed toilet seats, 24hour grocery stores, and and the just plan out geneeral foreignness (regardless of how Western it looks on the outside) of this place. I will also never miss the amazing helpfullness and politeness of the Japanese people. All you need is a bow and a smile, and you will get one back in return. It is truly a place that has something for everyone. Well, really, many things for everyone, but you know what I mean.

Can:t wait to upload the rest of the pictures, or show them to you when we arrive home.
