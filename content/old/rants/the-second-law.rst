Basically, what the FSCK are people thinking when they pick up the
goddamned phone?!

As a dedicated (read: indentured) employee of $COMPANY\_NAME, i get the
distinct pleasure of answering the phone to people (and i use the term
loosely) who only recently took the evolutionary steps necessary to
stand on their hind legs and reach the phone. It's jobs like mine that
provide evidence that the human evolutionary journey is only barely
begun.

It's like talking to monkeys, without the hassle of washing feces off
one's clothes afterwards.
