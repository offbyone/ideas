It\'s a small thing, to some, and i forgot to even post on it, but i finished my last exam two days ago. Semester three of eight is finished, and i\'m still cruising along.

Also, yesterday, i received the first scholarship of my university years. It wasn\'t anything really big, but never complain about an extra thousand dollars :)
