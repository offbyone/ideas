I'm sure we all know about "google":http://www.google.com/ since, well,
we all have to find stuff sometimes. But do we all know about these
funky `hidden google
features <http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/20/1823206&mode=thread>`__?

If
"this":http://www.google.com/search?q=speed+of+light+in+cubits+per+fortnight&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
isn't just the wackiest thing i've ever seen on google, i don't know
"what is":http://www.google.com/help/features.html (though i'm sure
someone will show me...)
