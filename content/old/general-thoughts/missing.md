Well, to anyone that wants to get hold of me in the near- to mid-term future, be aware that I\'m going to be somewhat out of touch. Thanks to the necessity of money and paying for school with it, I am obliged to get my ass out of town and make a bunch of it. The downside to this? Well, let\'s just say I\'ll miss my (various) favourite things from home. And my computers.

Anyway, I\'ll be catching up on my e-mail pseudo-weekly, so i hope not to be missing completely.
