From when I sit now, it's only 22 hours before I can get my sorry ass
back to town and into the welcoming arms of my lovely ladyfriend.

From when I sit now, it's only 42 hours until I start seeing friends I
haven't gotten to socialize with in ages, or so it seems.

From when I sit now, it's only 54 hours until I get two whole days of
straight non-work time, either spend puttering around the yard and house
with the aforementioned lovely ladyfriend, or just communing with my
beloved digital domain.

From when I sit now, it's only 104 hours til my bliss ends, and I return
to work at 6 AM on Monday.

I think that the time shall be well spent. How about you folks? What's
on tap for \_your\_ weekend?
