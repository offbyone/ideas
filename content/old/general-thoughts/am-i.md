So, i\'m sitting on the couches in the bridge between buildings 5 and 6 yesterday, and listening to some guy go on - loudly and at length -about how he thinks stupid people are a waste, and how funny he\'s found it when someone he thinks is stupid gets fired, or humiliated, or mistreated\...

And so, i wonder.

In what way am i a better person than this loud, abrasive, offensive man?

This isn\'t a trivial question to me\... I know in my mind that i\'m different from him. Nonetheless, my opinions are similar on the surface, and probably seem as unpleasant to the casual listener. I *am* loud, i *am* abrasive, and i *am* offensive - at least my opinions frequently are.

I guess the only thing that comes to mind is that i don\'t seek pleasure in the misfortunes of others. I\'ve got a better understanding than most of the painful aftereffects of verbal and emotional abuse, so i\'m a bit more sympathetic to the plight of the underdog. So, i\'m less inclined to mock and ridicule those for whom i have no respect. Note, i say *less*, not un-.

But i\'m not sure that\'s enough to differentiate me. And that scares me a bit, because i don\'t want to be the sort of person that i felt that man was.

I\'m going to watch myself carefully, i think, and see if i can figure out what, if any, differences there are between us.
