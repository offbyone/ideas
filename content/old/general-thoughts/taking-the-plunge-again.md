So, tomorrow I'm heading out, early in the morning, to get back in the saddle at [Eden North](http://www.edennorth.com/).

Anyone want in?

### Update

Sadly, no jumping today, as the winds were too strong. Maybe tomorrow, although with rain forecasted all day, I'm not hopeful. Worst case? Next weekend...
