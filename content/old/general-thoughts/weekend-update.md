Another week, another few dollars in the bank.

Posting from home today, as the incommunicado situation in Mayerthorpe has apparently become permanent. I\'m still not sure why, but I *am* sure of that.

We got rained out again today, this is becoming a weekly thing, which, although pleasant for all kinds of reasons, is costing me money I could otherwise be making in spades. Such is life, though, and on balance I prefer to get away every once in a while. There are folks on the job who are actively angry when they get sent home, but I\'m not one of them, nor will I ever be.

I\'m a little irritated at the moment, though, since I was hoping on my time off to go to a stag party for an old college friend of mine, but the date of the party got moved one day back and thus Char and I will already be in Winnipeg, having left several hours before it began. So much for intricate planning and careful arrangement of events (wry look).

Had some interesting happenings on the way out of Mayerthorpe this morning, though. Just as Mir and I were on our way out of town, we got drafted to help out when the diesel tanker that was on its way to refill our fuel tanks rolled over and began leaking fuel. A bit hectic, to say the least. Quite the sight, too. Wish I\'d had a camera.
