Done at last! My first four months are completed. Semester one of eight is out of the way.

My final exam this afternoon was Chemistry 101, and i must confess, it was pretty gruelling. Not a lot of fun, not at all. But, at least it's over. It's not so much that i wasn't enjoying it as it is that i want to move on past the same old shit - all i did this semester, more or less, was repeat what i'd already done - just with more focus and less drinking. So there's nothing really new - even Chem was pretty much just a standard first-year science course, nothing too exciting.

Done, though :)

In other news, it appears that [telling children that there's no Santa Claus](http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-cgrinch13dec13,0,2491816.story?coll=sfla%2Dnews%2Dfront) is causing a bit of an uproar. The best part is where the school board's district spokesman says that the Santa they'll have in to visit the kids is "..the real deal"
