Amongst others, [Wil Wheaton](http://www.wilwheaton.net/mt/archives/001479.php#001479) has commented on a news story\... no, make that [\_non\_ story](http://www.penny-arcade.com/news.php3?date=2004-01-03)\... that is making my blood, at least, boil.

I play computer games too - and i play some fairly violent ones. And yet, oddly enough, i\'ve never thrown a punch in anger in my life. Weird, isn\'t it?

I invite you to follow the links in [this](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/30551) posting as well, and read a bit of the discussion for yourself.
