OK, Kenny, from last year in Peru, take 1 cuy (guinea pig), kill first (Canadian pet stores may not particularilly like this idea), skin, gut, split in half and grill with the necessary spicing, mostly salt and pepper (it tastes like chicken). Presentation is important, claws splayed, eyes forward. Agregado (extras), papas (potatoe how you want), aroz (rice), maize (corn).  
Actually, they dont spice their food, they serve it with really nice sauces, that is where the extra flavour is. Tonight I had a nice bowl of crab ?soup? that totally tasted of crab, it cost about \$7 but in Canada would have cost \$30+. Miranda had the smoked salmon that was gorgeous.  
Other than that, for those of you who dont know, I am now the owner of a first edition of the lord of the rings, yeah me and thank you Char and C.
