If you happen to be a reader of either of this site's child blogs,
Morruz or MildIllSon, they're sort of moved now.

Oh, the content already moved, but the blogs themselves are best reached
at a slightly different address:

Where, before, there was "http://www.offlineblog.com/morruz" and
"http://www.offlineblog.com/mildillson", now there are
"http://morruz.offlineblog.com/" and
"http://mildillson.offlineblog.com". The sidebar links are updated, and
feel free to head over there at your convenience, although
`somebody <http://mildillson.offlineblog.com/>`__ doesn't update often
enough, and `another somebody <http://morruz.offlineblog.com/>`__ isn't
traveling at the moment. Still, it bore mentioning.

In addition, I'm trying to convince Beau to upload something of his own
to the web. This something will NOT be work-safe, which should surprise
nobody who knows Beau, and might well be offensive to some, if I'm
lucky.
