What a weekend...

Let's see.

So, Char managed to whip up a ridiculously large meal for Dad's birthday
just yesterday. Starting with the appetizers and ending with dessert, we
ate for \_four hours\_. Yum! :)

Fondue is the best stuff on earth. It just doesn't get better than that.
You eat until you couldn't fit another bit in your stomach, and then,
after waiting a few minutes pass, you eat some more. And some more...

In other news, i - at last - own an "ipod":http://www.apple.com/ipod/ .
15 Gb of music that i can carry with me anywhere and... Well, i could
rant about how cool this is all day, but i think i'd better stop here
before someone comes over and forces me to buy a Mac or something.
Suffice to say, this toy makes me happy, big time.
