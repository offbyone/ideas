Although we already pay a levy on our blank media under the assumption that we will illegally copy media, thereby \-- under the law of the land \-- rendering such copying legal, it seems that some segments of our lawmaking bodies wish to \[strip this right from us\]([http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1118271756635\\\_30/?hub=CTVNewsAt11](http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1118271756635\_30/?hub=CTVNewsAt11)).

Which is, regrettably, not surprising in the least.

Feh. Just thought I\'d pass that on, as well as a link to \[Digital Copyright Canada\](<http://www.digital-copyright.ca/>), a blog focusing on those kinds of issues. Worth keeping an eye on, if only for the occasional sense of outrage.

In other news, this week I completed the first runs of the application controller that I\'ve been working on. My boss is in the process of adding new functionality all over the place, but at least he has time to help me out whenever I make my thrice-plus-daily visits to his office. All in all, it\'s been a satisfying week, although I\'m alone for the weekend, as \[Char\](<http://xraystar.livejournal.com>) is out camping with some friends for the next two days.
