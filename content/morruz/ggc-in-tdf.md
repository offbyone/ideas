First, there was no rain until 20:00h today so we got to go to the national park where there is a variety of fierce local fauna that one has to be careful around. Nice hike. Those bunnies really do have fangs.  
Last night, Morris wanted GGC so we put together a little meal (Dad really doesn't know how to cook for two - mir) that served a whole whack of the crowd in the common room. Personally, I was very proud when people started having seconds even though I made the single biggest mistake that I´ve ever done cooking. I now have another version of the meal.  
Morris really does like to surf the night life portion of Ushuaia. She slept in til ?11:00h. I guess her feet were tired. I WOULDN´T KNOW.  
Salud, moi
