Yesterday, on the way home from \_Lobster Telephone\_, a play starring Mark Meer as Salvador Dali (+ others), A lady on the bus spoke to me, pointing out the beautiful colours of the sunset happening outside the bus window behind me.

It\'s a rare thing, that people speak to strangers in public. It caught me off guard, but I made an effort to be responsive, in order to leave her feeling as though she should do it again. That, and it really \_was\_ a very pretty sunset.
