This won't mean much to any of you, but with a bit of finagling I've
managed to come up with a reasonably well thought out solution to a
problem that has vexed me at work, having to do with porting a logging
toolkit from C, where it has been working well for years, to Java where
our new development is being done.

It's not perfect, but it's a big step up.

Now, of course, it must survive the peer review process, but that's
another story.
