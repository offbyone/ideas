So, the other shoe to which I referred has, in fact, dropped.

I have been informed that despite my dislocation being just my first, I
am among the unlucky ones whose dislocation caused a fracture that
renders my shoulder extremely unstable from here on out.

200 km/h facewinds and hard openings -- or openings of any kind -- would
appear to be out of scope for the pre-surgery future and, until I talk
to a surgeon, potentially post-surgery too.

You can imagine how happy this makes me.
