It's a good sign, if you ask me, when your christmas gift comes with a letter like this
one (boldface text highlighted by Matt):

> As requested in a letter from your client, Mr. Chris Staros, dated October 3, 2006,
> please be advised that I have now completed my review of the goods, namely a boxed set
> of three graphic novels, entitled [_Lost Girls_](http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog.php?type=12&title=219). The three graphic novels were reviewed in
> full, and were found not to fall within the provisions of [_Customs Tariff_ item 9899.00.00](http://www3.sympatico.ca/toshiya.k.ncl/d9-1-1-2-04-98.htm).
>
> This boxed set was found to contain **depictions and descriptions of incest** and

I've already read the "boxed set entitled _Lost Girls_," and it's pretty impressive. Good
writing, although it could have done without the last page and a half of book three, which was
just wankery of a different sort, if you ask me, but other than that it was a lot better than
I expected. It really was _erotica_, as opposed to _pornography_.

I would [recommend it](http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2006/06/lost-girls-redux.html), but... well, truth be told I'm not sure many of you reading this would enjoy it.
It's pretty bent in some places, and really does have to be read in its entirety to appreciate it.
