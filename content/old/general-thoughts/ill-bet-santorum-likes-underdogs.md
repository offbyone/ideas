Okay, that title bears little, if any, relation to the content of this post. This post consists mainly of a pointer to this wonderful [critique of the underdog narrative in science journalism](http://www.scientificblogging.com/adaptive_complexity/bad_science_journalism_and_the_myth_of_the_oppressed_underdog), found by way of Slashdot.

I've never given it the attention it deserves, obviously, but science reporting in the popular media \-- from the news outlets to the movies \--is pretty bad. Cinema is especially guilty of portraying the scientific establishment as a repressive overmind bent on quashing any threat to some imagined orthodoxy, and popular science writing isn't a lot better.

I hope you enjoy the article.
