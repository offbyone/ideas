Interesting\...

Char and I, sitting in our apartment, noticed a strange siren from outside the door. Turns out our building isn't really all that well-equipped with loud fire alarms. Not that I mind; I'd notice them. Char, however, would not, if she were sleeping\...

But I digress.

So, one of the 19th-floor penthouse suites was aflame in a serious way. Fire licking at the roof, smoke sheeting out. I wish I had a camera. Or, for that matter, apartment insurance.

I'm pretty pleased with the fire department -- less than one hour from alarm to all clear.

Nifty stuff, this whole "Fire" thing.

| Turns out that the fire was, in fact, confined to the balcony of the suite. Hockey equipment + careless smoker == no hockey equipment + lots of smoke.

You live, you learn, I guess.
