OK, I did Alexandria. Different historical place as it is alot more greco-roman in flavour. It really is a large resort town for Cairo. Population of 4-6,000,000 but about triple that in summer. I did go to El Alamein museum and cemetery. It's not a tour I would overly recommend but it was important to me. You don't really see the battle site as I was told there are still lots of land mines, about two a day still hurting people. My guide is studying for his Phd in Egyptology. I was asked at least twice to sponsor someone to come to Canada.  
On my last morning I had about 4 hours to kill so walked to the citadel, about 1.5 hrs each way around the bay. people were shocked. When I went to get my shirt I had a taxi all afternoon and he took me to a great hole in the wall restaurant, not cheap but good sea food. Later I actually found a cheap bar for beer 10 minutes from the hotel.  
I have to keep saying it, people are very friendly just watch out for the friendly who wants you to come to his store for his card.  
This is my last day in Egypt, I fly out tonight for an overnight to Kenya.  
The weather has been nice, some hot days but mostly 15 to 25. I've actually seen clouds.  
Boy am I saving up a ton of punch buggies.  
I'd really like to see Christopher drive here, at first he would love it, horns to pass, to clear the way, just to make noise, to signal it's OK to come in my part lane. You would really get irate at the people who drift across lanes though. In grid lock, there is lots, its a miracle there aren't more accidents.  
Hope you're all well, luv, moi
