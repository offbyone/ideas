There's a
"discussion":http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/09/2134215 going
on on one of the forums I frequent for tech news and debate, and it's a
bit interesting. It's about "protecting our parents' PCs" from the
viruses, adware, and general nastiness of the net. The attitudes being
espoused on there make for an interesting read.

Basically, the trend is something like this: Either A) "I don't do
Windows," B) "I installed $(GEEK\_OS) on their PC. Now, they can't run
viruses. Or, for that matter, anthing *else*," or C) "I tell them to ask
their friends/other children."

It's funny, because I recently gave a computer to the least tech-savvy
person I know, my mother. Why is this funny? Because, while she might
not be technically-inclined, she is more than able to \_follow simple
instructions\_! When I set up the computer, I gave her the "attachment
spiel" -- you know the one, the "don't open \_anything\_ that you were
not *told in advance was coming*" spiel -- and, heaven forfend, she
\_listened\_! It's like magic. She doesn't get the idea that "this one
is different," she treats the computer with the same care that any
complicated device deserves. I'm fairly impressed by this.

It's also worth noting that my sister just got wireless too, and she's
the same way, in both respects. So it's not a lack of technical skill
that leads to this, I'm pretty sure that it's just plain stupidity that
leads to the virus epidemics. Because, if my mom can figure out the
technology to an extent that allows her minimal use of the computer to
be safe, \_anyone intelligent\_ can.

I guess something I see in this is a need to make these wonderful,
complex, intricate machines more comprehensible, more proactive in their
own defense. Let's face it: Mom shouldn't \_have\_ to learn how to do
virus scans, nor should she have to learn all of these minefields in
order to get use out of her computer. She shouldn't be scared to use it,
concerned that, in doing something basic, she'll break it. Improvements
in the user interfaces of the better applications out there are one of
the ways of acheiving this, and I hope to do my part to accelerate that.
