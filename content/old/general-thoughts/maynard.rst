Nothing on internet censorship (note: If you're on a Canadian ISP and
reading this, there are now sites blocked for all Canadians. Right now
they're kiddie porn only... but it's a short step from that to deciding
other sites are \_objectionable\_ and blockable. Your ISP -- the one you
\_pay to provide you with internet access\_ -- is doing this. Respond as
you will).

What I'm actually posting on is an excellent [interview with Maynard
James Keenan](http://www.avclub.com/content/node/55757) (of Tool) at the
Onion AV Club.

The quote that really got me is this one:

| >All I can do is say I smell a rat. I don't know where it is or what
  kind of rat it is, but as an artist,
| >I can express how [I feel about it]. But I couldn't responsibly stand
  up and tell people which way to go,
| >because then I'm just as guilty as the people who are telling
  everybody else what to do and where to
| >go.

He's quite a guy, one with whom I've no doubt that I could argue for
days.
