So, i'm sitting on the couches in the bridge between buildings 5 and 6
yesterday, and listening to some guy go on - loudly and at length -
about how he thinks stupid people are a waste, and how funny he's found
it when someone he thinks is stupid gets fired, or humiliated, or
mistreated...

And so, i wonder.

In what way am i a better person than this loud, abrasive, offensive
man?

This isn't a trivial question to me... I know in my mind that i'm
different from him. Nonetheless, my opinions are similar on the surface,
and probably seem as unpleasant to the casual listener. I *am* loud, i
*am* abrasive, and i *am* offensive - at least my opinions frequently
are.

I guess the only thing that comes to mind is that i don't seek pleasure
in the misfortunes of others. I've got a better understanding than most
of the painful aftereffects of verbal and emotional abuse, so i'm a bit
more sympathetic to the plight of the underdog. So, i'm less inclined to
mock and ridicule those for whom i have no respect. Note, i say *less*,
not un-.

But i'm not sure that's enough to differentiate me. And that scares me a
bit, because i don't want to be the sort of person that i felt that man
was.

I'm going to watch myself carefully, i think, and see if i can figure
out what, if any, differences there are between us.
