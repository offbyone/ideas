It wasn't, although the hope was there. Given the fact that in Canada we have [only six WWI veterans left alive](http://www.news.gc.ca/cfmx/CCP/view/en/index.cfm?articleid=119219), it makes me wonder how much more quickly we'll forget the lessons of that first world war now?

Although WWII casts a longer shadow over my generation, the first war was in its time considered to be so horrific that no one would ever choose to war again.

I wonder what, if the dead of that war could see the world today, what they would have to say to their children?
