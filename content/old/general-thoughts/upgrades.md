Well, I just got handed a new... well, _newer_, system. It's equivalent to Char's laptop, which is more than 5 times faster than the old system.

It's nice. And I can take it home, if I want to. Which is pretty cool, if you ask me.

So I'm pretty happy -- I have a real system to work on again. Yay me!
