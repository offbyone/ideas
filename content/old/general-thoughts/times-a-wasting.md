I know that this is going to change over the course of the year, at least to some extent, but **damn** this course is pointless.

What course? The one you\'d expect: PSYC104. Thus far, all we\'ve done is define \"Hypothesis\" and \"Theory\", and received a bit of a refresher on the scientific method. This, in 2.5 classes of 90 minutes. Can\'t imagine where we\'ll get to by the end of the course, at this rate\... Not too far, i imagine.

Bah

Of course, i\'ll eat my words if i do poorly, won\'t i? :)
