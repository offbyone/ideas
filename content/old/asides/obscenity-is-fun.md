| It's a good sign, if you ask me, when your christmas gift comes with a letter like this
| one (boldface text highlighted by Matt):

| \> As requested in a letter from your client, Mr. Chris Staros, dated October 3, 2006,
| \> please be advised that I have now completed my review of the goods, namely a boxed set
| \> of three graphic novels, entitled [_Lost Girls_](http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog.php?type=12&title=219). The three graphic novels were reviewed in
| \> full, and were found not to fall within the provisions of [_Customs Tariff_ item 9899.00.00](http://www3.sympatico.ca/toshiya.k.ncl/d9-1-1-2-04-98.htm).
| \>
| \> This boxed set was found to contain **depictions and descriptions of incest** and
| \> \**bestiality**, which are indicators of **obscenity*\* under current Canada Border Services
| \> Agency guidelines. However, these depictions and descriptions are **integral** to the
| \> development of an intricate, imaginative and artfully rendered storyline. When
| \> considering the "**internal necessities**" test, it appears that, in this instance, the portrayal of
| \> sex is necessary to a wider artistic and literary purpose. As a result, it is my opinion that
| \> this boxed set does not constitute obscenity.
| \>
| \> The boxed set was also found to contain depictions and descriptions of sexual acts
| \> **involving persons under the age of 18**. However, it would appear that these
| \> representations serve a legitimate purpose related to art and to the very detailed story
| \> about the **sexual awakening and development** of the three [main]([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_%28Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland%29](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_%28Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland%29)) [female]([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Gale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Gale)) [characters]([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan)).
| \> Furthermore, it is my opinion that this item does not pose an undue risk of harm to
| \> persons under the age of 18 years. As a result, it is my opinion that this boxed set does
| \> not constitute child pornography.
| \>
| \> As the boxed set entitled _Lost Girls_ does not constitute obscenity or child
| \> pornography, it does not fall within the provisions of tariff item 9899.00.00. Its
| \> importation into Canada is therefore allowed.

| I've already read the "boxed set entitled _Lost Girls_," and it's pretty impressive. Good
| writing, although it could have done without the last page and a half of book three, which was
| just wankery of a different sort, if you ask me, but other than that it was a lot better than
| I expected. It really was _erotica_, as opposed to _pornography_.

| I would [recommend it](http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2006/06/lost-girls-redux.html), but\... well, truth be told I'm not sure many of you reading this would enjoy it.
| It's pretty bent in some places, and really does have to be read in its entirety to appreciate it.
