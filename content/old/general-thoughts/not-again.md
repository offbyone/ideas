I'm sitting here in my basement writing this as all around me falls what looks to be another biblical downpour. I'm listening to both Metallica and the sound of rain falling outside -- since I can hear the latter even over the former.

I'm beginning to think that I won't be working tomorrow :)

So far, the floor is dry, but it's still early. I don't imagine that staying up and waiting will help anything, but I can't help but think that I'm going to have a hard time sleeping with this happening. The yard is as clear as it has ever been, so hopefully that's all it'll take.

Stay dry, damn it, stay dry...

### Update (x2):

One: Yes, I am working. Sympathy is welcome, as I expect to be knee deep in muck for most of the day (since, instead of surveying, my foreman has decided that I'm most useful as a labourer. Yay, filter cloth!)

Two: As far as I can tell, no leakage anywhere in the house. Happiness!
