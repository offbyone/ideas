As the post title (and categorization) suggest, I started work today.

I think I'm going to like this job. I'm not saying it'll be perfect, but this is going to be an interesting experience.

So far, however, it's been\... dull. I have a workstation that was actually just coming into high-end when I graduated from high school, and a desk that affords me less privacy than, well, my new location at home.

Still, the people are pleasant and intelligent, and the work won't be dull -- once I have a machine that can do it.
