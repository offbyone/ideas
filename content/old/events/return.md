Mish-mash:

| * Still haven't heard what the mark is for my (bombed) c340 exam. I'm awaiting it with trepidation, but probably won't hear soon enough to make a decision on whether to drop the course.
| * Back from mexico. Apparently, according to Char, the sunburn on my right ankle verges on a second-degree burn. No pics, but trust me, it's bad. Even pulling on socks feels like I'm scraping it with a razor blade.
| * Schoolwork is beating the hell out of me. This is nothing new.
| * Hunter S. Thompson committed suicide about 10 days ago. Not one of my heroes, per se, but still a sad thing. That man knew how to _live_.
| * I want another sandwich.
