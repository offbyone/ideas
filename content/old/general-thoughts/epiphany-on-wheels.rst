I had an epiphany yesterday: I \_don't want to drive to work\_. Me. The
lazy one.

My \_gods\_ was traffic stressful, after the relative pleasure of
cycling. People were asshats, the car was too hot, and the whole
experience conspired to make me look forward to winter, and a need to
drive, with no small amount of apprehension. Really, I'm happier biking.

Mind you, no rain on me, yet ;)
