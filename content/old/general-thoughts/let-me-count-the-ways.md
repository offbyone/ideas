I can't even _start_ to enumerate the ways that this program to [teach schoolchildren copyright](http://www.musicmanifesto.co.uk/) offends my sensibilities.

Along with the american MPAA, who is also doing [something]([http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2004/04/25/laying_down_the_copyright_law____to_children?pg=full](http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2004/04/25/laying_down_the_copyright_law____to_children?pg=full)) like it, this program is part of a concerted effort by holders of modern, excessively-long copyrights to indoctrinate young children into toeing the party line.

Unlike [some groups](<http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/25/1629228&tid=146>) I don't advocate the idea that 'Information wants to be free', nor do I believe that any entity, be they an artist or a massive conglomerate like the (MP\|RI)AA, is obligated to give away their intellectual property just because the marginal cost of duplication is so small. However, I object to the entry of private industry lobby groups into an education system that is already starting to show signs of commercial decay.

The Register in the UK has [a writeup]([http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/05/uk_school_copyright_lessons/](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/05/uk_school_copyright_lessons/)) on this, and there is an [open letter](<http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/8/5/151113/8977>) from a British citizen on [kuro5hin](<http://www.kuro5hin.org/>) that indicates a nice, clear set of objections to the policy.

Sometimes I think that, while we're all looking the other way, our rights as human beings -- not as abstract consumers of goods -- are simply going to be cancelled along with the latest crop of post-Seinfeld flops.

This shit worries me. What in the hell are we doing, letting this happen?
