Just half an hour ago, the server upon which I have stored all my e-mail for years back, all my source code for the same, and in which I have placed much trust abruptly decided that no, I did _not_ need any of the above, much less the sundry files of many kinds and sources that I had assiduously collected over the past couple of years.

Basically, it ate an entire filesystem entire.

So, now I have no mail archive, and in fact the mail server doesn't seem to be working any more at all. So I'll be migrating to gmail after all, it seems \-- although there's not much to worry about with regards to changing addresses this time around, since the old addresses will just forward to gmail.

Bah. This _really_ sucks.
