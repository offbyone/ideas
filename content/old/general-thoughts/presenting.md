Two times in the last week I've had to do class presentation, and although I can't speak for the actual _skill_ that I have, I do seem to have a knack for talking.

Which, come to think of it, might come as no surprise :)

Anyway, this week marks the end of classes for this semester and, in fact, all but one of my final exams. That one, which takes place next week, will be murderous, but other than that I'll be content with my grades for the semester.

I wish I could say the same thing for work. My job has been a frustrating one lately, staring blankly at a piece of code from IBM and trying to figure out why it isn't working the way it's supposed to. It has to do with migrating our product to a new version of a particular platform and, while in theory it should be easy, we've always had a bit of a fragile relationship with this platform, and I'm bearing the brunt of it. The work would be satisfying if I were getting anywhere, but I'm not, and a deadline is looming. I predict some overtime next week, as we have two major deliverable dates.

Honestly, though, it's not all bad.
