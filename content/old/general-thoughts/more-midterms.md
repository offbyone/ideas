This is getting out of hand, i think\... I know i need to work on my study habits, but for some reason, i can't get off my ass and get at it - which is frustrating as all hell :/

I think i know the reason, though, and it's a cruel irony that what makes school so easy now, and always has, is going to screw me *right* up come next year, or the year after\... Why should i study if i don't seem to need to? This isn't a new problem - it's not like my previous educational experience hasn't taught me how easy school can be. The only time i ever ran into problems was in the last year of college, where i fucked up badly - but i attribute that in no small part to external influences\... (yes, i'm looking at you, Beau ;)

Here's hoping that somewhere down the line, i can get my ass together and fix my study habits, before it's too late.

And, on that note, it's off to do some schoolwork for me :)
