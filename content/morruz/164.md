Well, it's Paris.

INSERT_MAP

Time is tight (I prepaid for 15 minutes in an internet cafe) so I won't go into excessive detail here, but it's pretty nice so far. Expect Char to get detailed to a degree I can't hope to match, but here's a scattering of impressions:

I'm insecure about my french, which should not be surprising. I do okay, but the sewer tour pretty much flew over my head, whilst Char followed along pretty well. I'm not bitter, but I wish I'd gotten more out of it.

The food is every bit as good as rumour and legend have it.

We hit Paris in time to catch a well-regarded outdoor market, which provided us with rabbit, cheese, and pain italienne for breakfast. Mmm.

The weather has been windy and humid. The Eiffel tower was high and crowded (and **windy**!) and a bit too vertiginous for Char.

Tomorrow, we're going to try for the catacombs, I hope. The Louvre is still on my list.

That's all I've got for now.
