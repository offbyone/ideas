I just had my attention brought to the EFF(Electronic Freedoms
Foundation)'s `User's Guide to EULA(End-User License
Agreement)s <http://www.eff.org/wp/eula.php>`__, which is a nice,
human-(read: non-lawyer)-readable introduction to the wooly wonders of
licensing for software.

Trust me, read one of those some time. They're bloody creepy, and
they're getting worse, not better.
