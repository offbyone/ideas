Hmmm, what have I not told about Concepcíon?  Well our second day there was spent just south of the city, in a town called Lota.  There we visited a really charming and well-tended park, and an abandoned coal mine.  The coal mine was active from 1840 to 1982, when it was turned into a tourist attraction.  It is the only mine known to have natural ventilation and is actually below the ocean floor (Lota is a coastal town).  I would be able to give more details about this if my spanish was better, for the tour was only in Spanish.  Our trip to and from Lota was accomplished using the local buses, which Doerte will remember with us seemed to be such a confusing and daunting affair.  But with a little direction from the tourist office and helpful hostel staff, Dad and I feel we are getting a small handle on it.  We didn't get lost, in any case.  
So we are now safely in Pucòn, after travelling approximatly 5 hours by bus from Concepcíon.  The scenery on the way was just fantastic.  The first hour out of Conce was great, we were on a secondary highway, just two lanes, no real towns along the way, just a few farms and such, with the greenery being split between evergreen and deciduous, so that the forests looked almost like we might see at home (except that there are no poplars here that I can see, but I'm not sure what the major tree type is here.  Dad and I both have expressed an interest in knowing more about the flora here).  Then we were back on the PanAmericana Highway, back in rich farmland, with vinyards and orchards and cornfields.  The last part of our bus trip was more towards the inland, where the fields became grain and we saw more and more cows, and of course the Andes lurked on the horizon.  We are staying in a small cabin in this great little town, the cabin has 3 double bedrooms, and a kitchen and a living room to share.  Very quaint and very comfortable.  Oh, and the view out our front door is an active volcano covered in snow.  Yeah, it's pretty impressive (if I had the software for my camera with me I could show it to you now).

So we have only just arrived in this town, and expect to stay for a few days, possibly to take in some  adventurous activities like rafting, hiking to the top of a volcano, and maybe just to up the adrenaline ante, relaxing in some natural hot springs.  Ahh me.  So while I ponder the next couple of days, I think I will go for a dip in the lovely mountain lake Villarrica that our town sits on the shore of.

P.S. is it snowing yet in Edmonton?
