Summary: How the wandering.shop is laid out as of today, and where it needs to go next.

Almost a month ago, during the first wave of the latest Twitter exodus, I described [how Wandering.Shop survived the initial rush of demand]({filename}/rst/2022-11-07-mastodon-hosting-part-1.md) and stabilized after running an upgrade at the same time as we got slammed with massive load.

In this post, I'll talk a bit about what the shop looks like today, where it can scale in the future, and some of the work I'll be putting into it to make it more robust in the future.
