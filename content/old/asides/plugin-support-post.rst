| ## Update
| Support requests can now be filed at [my support
  site](http://offby1.no-ip.org:8080)

Please use the appropriate project, and \_leave a valid e-mail address\_
or don't expect a lot of action.

A warning: Don't write in a way that may be construed as spammy -- maybe
the best way would be to leave a one-line request for support and your
e-mail address in the field, which will \_not\_ be shown. I will then
respond and ask what you need.

Thanks, and I apologize for the hoops, but 10+ spam/day, even using
gmail, was too much for me.
