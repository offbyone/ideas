Life is pretty good, these days.

As seen over on :simon:'s site, I just finished helping him haul his whole life over to Vancouver for school. While there, we visited the grandparents, who are well, and at their urging got to go skydiving out by the ocean. It's pretty sweet, seeing water on three sides of you while you fly. Not something you get here in the flatlands of Alberta, I guarantee.

Other than that, well, sorry about the spam bombing of the last few days. For some reason, my blog spam filter got overwhelmed, and just\... quit. It's gone now, but if you commented in the last few days on something, it may well have vanished in the purge. I thing I killed only spam, but I can't be sure.

I wish I had more interesting things to report, but I don't.
