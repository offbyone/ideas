Well, two. If you count speaking ones. About ten, if programming languages figure into it.

Which reminds me -- I'm up from 44.78% to 50.68% on the [Geek test](http://www.innergeek.us/). (Featured here on [30 May, 2003](http://www.offlineblog.com/backlog/2003/05/30/test-yourselves/)) All of you should take it, let me know where you sit now.

Lots of school work to get done. Not to mention (this weekend, at least) helping Ali move, [Char](http://xraystar.livejournal.com)'s book club, and just getting to _see_ the lovely lady, which happens too rarely lately, what with work and all that school stuff I do.

It'll be nice to see [Matt](http://www.offlineblog.com/mildillson/) & [Amy](http://lashingtail.blogspot.com/), though -- It's been nearly a month.
