OK, that was a flights. From departure to bed at 4:00 in Cairo in 32 hours, we are 9 hours ahead of GP. All connections went smooth including no long treks at any airport. I even had 4 seats to sleep across the Atlantic. Arrival went smooth, my pick up just took me through easy. Actually all security was smooth. By the way, I have seen palm trees, lots actually. Got into many short meet the stranger chats along the way, especially in Amsterdam meeting people from everywhere.  
Cairo itself looked quite cosmopolitan and clean at that time of the night oin zero sleep. Today our trip to the local pyramids showed more what I expected. Traffic actually rivaled south america this afternoon. Room is clean and definetely OK. Met my group, 14 in all, one of special interest, ha ha. Went inside a tomb, looked at the Egyptian museum based only on ancient Egypt and it would take a long time to actually explore. Tut's gold mask and all that stuff. Only 1 local meal so far and no beer but that is about to change, 57 hours on 2 sleep is a bit of a stretch so pardon any spelling errors. My transfer pick up gut, Macmoud was real nice.  
People are friendly, lots of english. The sellers at the Giza pyramids were on the extreme side though.  
luv, moi
