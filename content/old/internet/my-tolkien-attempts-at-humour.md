I\'ve stumbled upon more than a couple of decent shots at Tolkien-related humour in the last few days, so i figured i\'d share them with you all. Of course, most of the people reading my site are familiar with the [\*very\* secret diaries](http://home.nyu.edu/~amw243/diaries/) kept by the Fellowship on their journey. What you may not have seen is the two, and soon to be more, new ones that have been recovered and posted to a livejournal - They are [Aragorn\'s](http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=cassieclaire&itemid=21484) and [Theoden\'s](http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=cassieclaire&itemid=22029). Hey, if the content bothers you, just be glad it\'s not [Slash fiction](http://www.femgeeks.net/tolkien/archive.html). (NSFW; [What is \'Slash\'?](http://members.aol.com/RtNicholas/private/what.htm)) (Basically, that last link is so that people don\'t claim i sent them without warning.)

Also of note is a posting on [/.](http://slashdot.org/) pointing out \"What if someone else had written Tolkien?\" to fairly amusing effect. There are such luminaries as Hemingway and T. Pratchett amongst the hypothetical writers. Though the [originating page](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?s=ce24f67f4391402642140618dcde1e00&threadid=138905&perpage=50&pagenumber=1) is currently down for the count, having been [slashdotted](http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/slashdot-effect.html) into oblivion, a kind poster [duplicated](http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=49969&cid=5031644) most, if not all, of the entries posted.

And, finally, for people who\'re tired of it all, i direct you to the [Tolkien Sarcasm Page](http://flyingmoose.org/tolksarc/tolksarc.htm). Don\'t be a stranger, now!
