About two hours ago, as i write this, the NASA space shuttle Columbia
lost contact with mission control while coming in for a landing. As of
this writing, it is known ([CNN
link](https://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/space/02/01/shuttle.columbia/index.html))
that the space shuttle, with seven astronauts on board, broke up above
central Texas at approximately 9 AM EST.

What more can I say?

The crew of the *Columbia* are Americans Col. [Rick Husband](https://www.space.com/missionlaunches/bio_husband.html),
USAF, commander; Comdr. [William McCool](https://www.space.com/missionlaunches/bio_mccool.html), USN,
pilot; Lt. Col. [Michael Anderson](https://www.space.com/missionlaunches/bio_mike_anderson.html),
USAF, payload commander; Capt. [David Brown](https://www.space.com/missionlaunches/bio_david_brown.html),
USN, mission specialist; [Dr. Laurel Clark](https://www.space.com/missionlaunches/bio_laurel_clark.html),
Comdr, USN, mission specialist; and [Kaplana Chawla](https://www.space.com/missionlaunches/bio_chawla.html),
mission specialist; and Israeli Col. [Ilan Ramon](https://www.space.com/missionlaunches/bio_ramon.html), IAF,
mission specialist.

**Update**:

It has turned up in my readings of commentary on this event that a CBC
Newsworld interviewer took this event as an opportunity to whip the
"American Arrogance" horse again (from [The Ghost of a Flea](https://web.archive.org/web/20030216210122/http://ghostofaflea.blogspot.com/2003_01_26_ghostofaflea_archive.html#88380587)):

I don't know how to respond to this... CBC is supposedly the Canadian
perspective. But that's just beyond the pale. I am going to reserve
further comment until i see the interview, or read a transcript thereof,
for myself, but...

Words fail me.

But they didn't fail Jeff Fecke ([Blog of the Moderate Left](https://web.archive.org/web/20050308123835/http://moderateleft.blogspot.com/2003_02_01_moderateleft_archive.html#88379180)):
