This week has been pretty stressful all around, but in the last few
days, thanks in no small part to Char, I've been feeling more relaxed.
We've been a bit tense, but it's... nicer. And I'm feeling better about
life as a whole than I have for a long while.

I'm trying to do more work around the house, partly because Char's
taking a class plus working full time... well, she *was* working full
time. She goes back to her sane schedule this coming week, which will
mean I'll get to see more of her. The other reason I want to do more
around the house is simple: I've had it pretty good for a long time, but
as long as Char's working to pay for our lifestyle there's no reason she
should have to carry the housework load. I acknowledge that there's
always going to be a gap, because there are things that I care about
that she does not, and vice versa, but I'm trying to narrow it down
some.

In other news, I have a reasonable hope that I'll be getting jump number
22 in tomorrow, weather permitting... which it seems not to be. Damn.

We'll see.
