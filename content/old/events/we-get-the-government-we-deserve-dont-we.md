As should be [known](http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2004/06/29/canada/elxn_wrap040629) by now, Canadians have spoken, and what they\'ve said is, essentially, \"Please, sir, can I have some more?\"

With everything that has come to light about the workings of the Liberal party in this country, we as a nation chose to re-elect a party led by a man who hides his own companies in offshore tax shelters. We chose to re-elect a party that has demonstrated itself incapable of being honest towards its electorate. We chose \-- for the \_fourth time running\_ \-- a party that has broken more campaign promises than some parties even \_make\_ (GST, anyone?)

We truly do get the government we deserve.

Here\'s to more of the same.
