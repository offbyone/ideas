We are presently as far south as we will be +/- a bit.  We were talking about the range of our travels.  For my enfants, west, north, east are roughly the same, who crossed what street.  But south, 2 of you have to work at it.

Supper, Kenny, salmon covered in avocado, wrapped in a pastry shell.  Bake.  Serve with a sauce of sauted carrots, zucccini, beets, peppers and capers. in butter, olive oil and ?maybe soya.  This is tasty.  Most of the food down here is basically fired in oil/butter and served.  Very little spicing.  Tomatoes are peeled.  Vegetables are fresh but not well presented.  It is not a culinary delight to talk about.

Something else I'd like to say, flowers.  They have lots and lots of different flowering plants down here.  Alot of blue ?dahlias? and other colors that nobody seems to pay any attention to.

This is interesting, I wish I could really tell you what its about, love you all, moi
