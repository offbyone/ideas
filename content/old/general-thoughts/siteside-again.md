First, apologies for the lack of real updates. Tomorrow I finish exams, and then I'll be back to posting.

In the meantime, I have added a new comment spam trapper (because it was getting out of hand) to the site, which may or may not generate weirdness for you who comment on the site. As such, please let me know via e-mail if you have troubles commenting. I'm trying to cut down on admin time for the site, so that I can focus on posting more :)
