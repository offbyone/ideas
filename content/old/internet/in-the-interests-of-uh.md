[This is NOT safe for work!]([http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=54](http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=54) "Donna's World Famous Long and Short of it!") But is is damned funny. Essentially, a groupie rating list of metal stars - Mostly hair-metal rockers, but some more obscure ones, too (Dani Filth, anyone? :)

I'm not sure how i feel after reading this one, but it sure as hell is funny.
