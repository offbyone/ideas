Here's something that I will do my damnedest to teach my child: Just
because you worked hard doesn't mean you worked *well*.

    In line with Dean Hogge’s observation are Professor Greenberger’s
    test results. Nearly two-thirds of the students surveyed said that
    if they explained to a professor that they were trying hard, that
    should be taken into account in their grade.

    Jason Greenwood, a senior kinesiology major at the University of
    Maryland echoed that view.

    “\ **I think putting in a lot of effort should merit a high
    grade**,” Mr. Greenwood said. “\ **What else is there really than
    the effort that you put in?**\ ”

    “If you put in all the effort you have and get a C, what is the
    point?” he added. “If someone goes to every class and reads every
    chapter in the book and does everything the teacher asks of them and
    more, then they should be getting an A like their effort deserves.
    If your maximum effort can only be average in a teacher’s mind, then
    something is wrong.”

*emphasis mine*

Mr. Greenwood, you are correct in one thing: Something *is* wrong. It's
not what you think it is, but you got at least part of that right. I'd
grade that thought a D.
