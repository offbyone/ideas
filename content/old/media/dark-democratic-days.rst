Ahh, politics.  I love the smell of...

Shit.

It would appear, from the news at least, that `checking a voting machine
can result in a $40,000 "repair"
charge <http://www.sltrib.com/ci_3646075>`__ regardless of any actual
damage to the machine itself.

There's a trend in the modern electoral machine in the Unites States
towards greater automation.  What there is not is a trend towards
correspondingly greater accountability.  He who counts the votes, &c.

I just find myself wishing that there would be some sense of actual
interest on the part of the public at large, but what there is, instead,
is a whole big steaming pile of apathy.  Hell,it's contagious -- I had a
hard time motivating myself to rant about it, and I can tell from the
pace of the text above that I'm really just phoning it in.

So what's the solution?
