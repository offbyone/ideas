I only learned of this incident maybe three months ago, but it really struck me: [Ignoring the orders of the Soviet](http://www.itpro.co.uk/blogs/categories/security/589/remember-the-forgotten-hero-who-saved-the-world.thtml), [Stanislav Petrov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov) elected *not* to push the button when faced with what appeared to be the start of a nuclear war.

He did this twenty-three years ago, today.
