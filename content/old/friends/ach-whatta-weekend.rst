Well, I can't say that this past weekend was a terrific one.

Oh, the details were mostly good. I had a good trip with Char, during
which she either slept or was happy to chat with me continuously about a
whole host of interesting things (PolySci == good conversation).
However, the details -- from some social awkwardness at the wedding
itself (on my part, sadly) to some bad news from home (ask Char; it's
her story to tell) meant that the trip turned out to be less happy than
I'd hoped.

I wish it had been more cheery, but I suppose I still enjoyed the trip;
the company was excellent, and even if the details were bad it doesn't
mean that there was no value in it.
