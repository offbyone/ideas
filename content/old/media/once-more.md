With Feeling.

Turns out a friend of \[Simon\](<http://vernondalhart.livejournal.com>)'s owns the soundtrack to, arguably, one of the better gimmick episodes of a television show ever produced.

So, I'm listening to the songs on it, and I can recall the show itself quite well. I am suddenly taken by a powerful urge to re-watch it, although I don't have the time\... or do I? I wonder if I could persuade \[Char\](<http://xraystar.livejournal.com>)\... I suppose \[Matt\](<http://www.offlineblog.com/mildillson/>) and \[Amy\](<http://lashingtail.blogspot.com/>) might be persuated to re-lend me those DVDs\...

I'm a crackhead. Maybe I should go with Angel instead?
