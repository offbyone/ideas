Yesterday, in Calculus I class no less, i got into an unexpected debate about the Israel/Palestine situation. One of my classmates is, apparently, quite interested in the situation, and felt the need to hold forth on the subject\... So, naturally, I rose to the occasion (since, as most of you know, i *love* a rousing debate. It was fun, but something about it rubbed me a bit wrong.

Is it me, or is it a bad sign when the person you\'re arguing with refers to all Arabs as terrorists, or animals who should be exterminated?

I don\'t think it\'s me.

Anyway, it pretty much occurred to me that there really wasn\'t a lot to debate there - it was analogous to trying to convince me of the validity of a \"god-fearing\" world-view. Not too likely, i\'m afraid\...

But\... Damn, it\'s fine to finally get into a real debate - even if it was a fairly poor one.

That is all.
