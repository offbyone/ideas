Well, i'm doomed.

Yep. Doomed.

And no, i don't mean `good Doom <http://www.doom3.com/>`__\ ed. I mean
fated for ill things.

It's tragic that the more my tastes for company, activity, and
sociability move away from the bar scene, the more I seem to find myself
*working* in them. It sucks. Oh, it's not like I really hate the job or
anything, i'm generally alright with the nature of the work. Sure, it's
crashingly dull, but so are a lot of other things that I find myself
doing. It's more like I have a distaste and lack of respect for the
patrons.

Alright, i'm sure that surprises nobody.

Anyway, this isn't a workblog, so posting on that topic is liable to be
minimal at the best of times, but i wanted to get that off my chest.

And i'm still trying to persuade a certain friend of mine to start
blogging about *his* job, so perhaps i shouldn't ride to hard on
workblogging.
