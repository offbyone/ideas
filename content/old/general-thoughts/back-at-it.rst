Yay! Semester two began today, and i'm really looking forward to this
set of courses. It's going to be a busy year, for sure, and i'm hoping
that i do as well as i did last semester (Both marked courses were As).

I have English again, the same course about which i've bitched over and
over again - i get to find out how well i did on the midterm, which i
admit i'm looking forward to. I felt pretty solid on that exam. It
remains to be seen whether there's any improvement in the overall
caliber of the course, though. Perhaps i'll be pleasantly surprised. And
then again, perhaps not.

Also on my plate this semester is the course that was the bane of my
existence last time i was being educated - Formal Systems and Logic,
CMPT272. This is basically the required math course for computer
programmers, thinly disguised as a computer course. It's all about
number theory, sets, discrete mathematics, logic, etc... I'm basically
expecting to have a fair amount of fun with it.

The only other course that i've started yet this year is Math 115. Same
prof. as last semester, which i approve of - he was an asshole, but he
knows his stuff. I don't think that he has any more patience for
stupidity than i do, and he and i have talked about the low quality of
public education in this country before. I'm looking forward to this
course.

Tomorrow, i start CMPT115. I predict ease. :)

And wednesday, Chem. W00! :)

Not a lot else to report, really.

What's up with you, readers dear? :)
