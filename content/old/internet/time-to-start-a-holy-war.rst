"`Why Religion Doesn't
Matter <http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/11/18/05434/162>`__", an
article at `kuro5hin.org <http://kuro5hin.org/>`__ is pretty much
guaranteed to piss off the religious sorts amongst my readers. That
being said, i think it bears a read, even if the idea makes you wanna
hit somebody... There's not much more i could say that hasn't already
been said in there, but i thought i'd toss this one off anyway - k5 has
always been one of the best sites on the net for this sort of thing, and
i'm always glad to pass more views off their way. For the tech-inclined
amongst you, think of it as the "thinking man's
`slashdot <http://slashdot.org/>`__", a place where reason, though it
doesn't rule, per se, it *does* dominate.

Go forth, and pontificate!

| Now, on the religion subject... /me ducks.
| If i see interest in it, i'll pursue some of the better links on the
  subject i've found. It can be a fascinating subject, no matter which
  side of the debate you find yourself on.
