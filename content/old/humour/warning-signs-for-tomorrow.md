This might mark me as exceptionally nerdy, but I just love this set of [warning signs for tomorrow](http://lifeboat.com/ex/warning.signs.for.tomorrow), dug up via the instapundit.

Some favourites:

![Ubiquitous Surveillance Warning](http://offby1.files.wordpress.com/2006/10/ubiquitioussurveillancewarning.jpg)

This is the scary one \-- it should probably be posted in most banks, office buildings, *my* building, and Britain.

![Nonstandard Spacetime Warning](http://offby1.files.wordpress.com/2006/10/nonstandardspacetimewarning.jpg)

Perhaps those times when you've got a project due the next morning *"all of a sudden"* even though you *never* let things sit that long?

![Lack of Internet Connectivity Warning](http://offby1.files.wordpress.com/2006/10/lackofinternetconnectivitywarning.jpg)

My life, according to Shaw, some days.

![Existential Warning](http://offby1.files.wordpress.com/2006/10/existentialthreatwarning.jpg)

I can just picture this hanging in an effete coffee shop, over books by Sartre, being studiedly ignored by a gaggle of pseudo-intellectual first-year philosophy students.

![Congnitive Hazard Warning](http://offby1.files.wordpress.com/2006/10/cognitivehazardwarning.jpg)

Seen over the magazine rack containing US, Cosmo, and Maxim.

![Autonomous Device Warning](http://offby1.files.wordpress.com/2006/10/autonomousdevicewarning.jpg)

I think I should get a shirt with this one on it ;)
