And then some words about my final lab - hell, those words now\... It was EASY!

Nuff said.

Now, onto the main topic. There\'s some *\`discussion \<http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/21787\>\`\_\_* going on about a really badly lost/thoroughly won [basketball game](http://espn.go.com/moresports/news/2002/1121/1464158.html). Now, this game (as you\'ll see from the article) was a high-school playoff game, and it was *very* poorly matched - the eventual score was 115-2. So, the uptick of this discussion, and the gist of the article seems to be that winning by a large amount is \'unsporting\'. Now, i\'m not one to support the madness of hockey dads pushing 4-yr-old Joey to be the next Gretzky, but i do subscribe to a fairly simple philosophy of sport.

Do Your Best.

Maybe this comes from my athletic background in solo sports - there\'s not really a \'point system\' in Swimming, oddly enough, though i\'d love to see how one could work :) Regardless, in my mind, there\'s just no place in competitive sports for failing to do one\'s best. You can bet that the losing team did their best, but from what i read, the winning team actively *tried* not to score for huge swathes of the game. This fricken sickens me. Are we so oversensitive (Yeah, dad - that one\'s for you after sending me that mail ;) that our precious wittle kiddies can\'t handle a serious loss?

If that\'s the case, may their deity of choice help them when the real world walks up and walks over them. It\'s gonna be a rough intro to life outside of highschool if this is the coddling they\'re being given now.
