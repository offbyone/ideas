Amazingly enough, despite the fact that he talks like he\'s got a mouthful of marbles, Sylvester Stallone makes an excellent interviewee\... by email, at least.

Ain\'t it Cool News has a \_long\_ series consisting of fans asking Sly questions, and some of the answers are just comedy gold, and \_not\_ because I\'m laughing at him, because I\'m laughing \_with\_ him, at the questioners.

You\'ll have to check out the whole set, but here\'s a sample answer:

| \>\> Please reconsider writing your autobiography! If not, would you consider writing a sequel
| \>\> to \'Sly Moves\' which would focus primarily on mental health & attitude instead of physical
| \>\> health? I\'m picturing a Stallone version of \'The Power of Positive Thinking\' - what do you think?

| \> Thank you very much. Iâ€™m flattered that you think Iâ€™m a candidate for stable mental health.
| \> But the truth be known, I am insane with long, horrible fits of sanity. Now, if you can make
| \> insanity work for you, thatâ€™s actually called creativity. If you canâ€™t, thatâ€™s called a menace to
| \> society. Thank you.
