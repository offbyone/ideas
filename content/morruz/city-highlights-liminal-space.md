The concept of a sleeper ferry is an interesting one. It is a place in and of itself, complete with all you need to live for whatever period of time you are there. But also, it is a vessel, bringin you from one place to the next. It's place in fiction and in history has been romantic, spooky, adventurous, and always dramatic. I'm still hard pressed to describe how I felt about our experience. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't epic or anything, but very interesting.

First, It was primarily a cargo ship, with some space left over for the few customers who are looking for passage through to Marseille, so it had a very industrial feel. At places, it was loud, big, gritty, and exposed, but it still had all amenities, good food, nice staff, was clean and tidy. There were no issues with sea sickness, realistically, the night passed with no feeling of being on water, really, other than that ... feeling .... that you know you are on water. Looking back on it, it almost feels like we were on the set of a movie.
