\[Volunteerism\](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteerism>) is one of those interesting \'isms\'.&nbsp; It\'s probably one of the most well-regarded \'isms\' by more people, but I admit that much like my reaction to charity, I have a decidedly contrary view of this practice.

And, it appears, I\'m not the only one.&nbsp; Here\'s \"\`To Hell with Good Intentions by Ivan Illich \<http://www.swaraj.org/illich_hell.htm\>\`\_\_,\" a transcript of a speech given in 1968 to a volunteer organization.&nbsp; I came across this by way of, as always, Metafilter, where a discussion on the validity of volunteering \[was taking place\](<http://www.metafilter.com/69436/Do-you-really-care-about-the-starving-children-of-Africa>). This was spurred by an interesting article decrying modern celebrity aid programs as \[development porn\]([http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18\\\_1\\\_paternalism.html](http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18\_1\_paternalism.html)) and calling out volunteerism as paternalistic behaviour\... which is how I have always sort of felt.

Poke about. It\'s a good debate.
