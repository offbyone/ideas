act, the complete works of (the \_non-evil\_) Sir Willy Shakespeare can
be... energetic. Three Fools Company put on an amusing show consisting
of 37 plays... in 97 minutes. Given that Hamlet on its own took 40 of
those, that's no mean feat. They did take advantage of the similarities
between the bard's comedies to mash 16 of them into three minutes of
simulcast babblery, but I'd say that Titus Andronicus as a cooking show
takes the cake. Figuratively speaking, of course.

Good times were had.
