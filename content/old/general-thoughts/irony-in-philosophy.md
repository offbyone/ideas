I'm looking at the front matter of one of my professors' [weblog](http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~wcooper/graymatter/index.html), which closely associates [Che Guevara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara) with the [Free Culture](http://www.freeculture.org/) movement.

Does anyone else see anything ironic in that? Rabid communist/socialist as an icon of Free Culture?

Faugh.
