It's a peculiar thing for me, given my generally materialistic bent, to be in a position where I simply don't want anything material \-- not actively, at any rate.

Over the course of the last year, I've been given two gifts that, between them, have transformed my life from one of material desire to one where I now have a hard time thinking of what I could ask that anyone ever give me as a gift.

One was the \[iPod\](<http://www.apple.com/ipod/>) that dad bought me for christmas, and this is a big one. Since getting it, I have listened to more music (in 8 months) than the five years previous all together. It's brought me back to a mental place where I can appreciate music at my leisure, and a place where I both seek new bands and appreciate old ones that I had let fall by the wayside. For example, right now I'm listening to Rammstein. Hard to go wrong with silly-ass techno-influenced german heavy metal :)

The other, though, is a bit smaller and would seem to be a really simple, small thing: This \[coffee maker\]([http://www.cuisinart.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi/en/item.cgi?item_id=DGB-600BC](http://www.cuisinart.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi/en/item.cgi?item_id=DGB-600BC)) has become indispensable in the week and a half since it came into our house. Imagine the joy of having fresh-ground, fresh-brewed coffee waiting for you every morning. It's so nice, I don't know what else to say, other than it's just that nice.

Yes, I'm gushing over a coffee maker. Deal with it.

This stuff makes me happy, and leaves me only coveting books and skydiving. And computer parts, but those are a whole other category unto themselves. C'est etrange, non?
