I know I harp on this one a lot, but perhaps [this](http://isc.incidents.org/diary.php?date=2004-06-29) will scare the last few holdouts amongst you away from using Internet Explorer for anything secure, or better yet, anything at all.

As [discussed](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/29/1913222&mode=thread&tid=109&tid=113&tid=126&tid=187&tid=95) on slashdot, the gist of this is that a sneaky program (that can install itself invisibly when you view a webpage that tries to install it) can insert itself into your browser and read your secure information (that'd be _credit cards_, folks!) *before* it's encrypted.

There _are_ alternatives, though:
[FireFox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) is one, and it's the one that I use. [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) is another, although it's not really my favourite. Also, there's the old standby, [Netscape](http://www.netscape.com/) although I wouldn't recommend it personally, and Netscape's spiritual successor [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) which is basically the big brother of Firefox.

Seriously, folks. This is serious business. Don't take chances unnecessarily.
