I\'ve mentioned these before, and someone who read the site indicated that they wished they could comment on the quotes\... or the links, i suppose.

I hope the links were interesting too, since they\'re the first part of the site to get this treatment, but here\'s how it works: The links on the main page are now commentable. They\'re the same as any other entry on the blog, but they only show up in the sidebar. As i understand it, the link shown should change pretty much every time the main page is rebuilt - ie: When a new comment is posted to an entry on the front page. Hopefully that\'s how it works, don\'t quote me on this :)

Quote commenting should be up within the next few days, so keep an eye open. I\'m having some fun modding the site a bit\... Though i\'m not touching the design, after the last time\... (/me shudders theatrically)
