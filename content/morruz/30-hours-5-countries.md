This is from Simon's office, we are back north of 49. A fairly uneventful trip other than the fact that it went so smoothly. We're tired but have to go pick up the pictures before supper and bed.  
Mendoza, read, Isabell and Walter and family were again a real nice treat to cap off the trip. Our supper at El Buque reminded us that Argentinian steak is just as good and that restaurant definetely can do what I call blue rare.  
WE ARE BACK, moi
