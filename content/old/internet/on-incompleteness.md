Stumbled upon this [interview](http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/articleprint.php?num=116) with a woman that wrote a \[biography\](<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393051692/104-3062222-1139939?v=glance>) of Kurt Gödel entitled _Incompleteness_. She makes some interesting statements regarding the widespread misinterpretation of Gödel's results, primarily amongst postmodernists and such.

Nothing that I didn't already feel myself, but it's interesting that a biographer would have found that Gödel felt the same. I can only imagine what it must have felt like for him to see, even during his own lifetime, his greatest work twisted by people who knew nothing of it, until they had interpreted it to mean the exact opposite of what Gödel had proved.
