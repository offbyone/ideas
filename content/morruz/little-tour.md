So, we did a small tour of Scotland. Rented a car in Liverpool and drove to Balloch the first day. Got up and looked at the end of Loch Lomond. Drove up along the lakes including Loch Ness past Inverness to the Balblair distillerry and had a great 1 on 1 tour and a few samples but not of the 1200 pound a bottle stuff. Returned to Elgin where Simon fell in love with the whiskey bar, Laichmoray Hotel, with more than 100 different whiskeys to try. Went and shot a round (I shot a 94, 4 bad holes). On 12 I was 6 inches off the green on a 276 par 4. We then drove past Aberdeen to Arbroath and had a great evening, Mitch runs a great Smugglers bar. Today we just drifted home, Simon asked me to find smaller roads for him to drive on.  
Tonight walking home it was so nice to stop and hear the quiet of Bangor.
