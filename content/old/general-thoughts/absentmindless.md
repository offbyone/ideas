Sorry, i know i haven\'t been posting anything. I\'m busily working at school and with Telus, and it\'s really damned draining. Between the long hours at work and the long hours at school, i barely get any time to myself, which means i\'m less communicative than i should be.

Hope things are well for the lot of you - updates will follow soon, once midterms are more over.
