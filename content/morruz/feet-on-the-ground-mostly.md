Quick post as this site is painful slow.  
Since I last posted we did an overnight train to Aswan, not recomended for the weak and tired, me but it got us here.  
Beer is 15-20 EP and hard to find, they do not drink publicly here. Yesterday went to the temple of Isis at Aswan, neat. Then did a Faluta boat sail around the island in the nile. Beautiful, laying on the deck on matresses having tea and talking with our group, very peaceful and recommended. Today saw the temple of Ramses II, best thing so far. It is out in the Sahara about 3 hours bus from Aswan. We just moved onto our cruise ship for the next 3/4 days of nile cruising so will post later.  
Our group is actually 3 of 14. Ours is coming together and visiting is fun. I'm rooming with 59 year old Micky from Australis as is most of our group. Tonight we play football against another group.  
Post later, moi
