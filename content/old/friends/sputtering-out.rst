It's been a very sociable week, and while I've enjoyed each and every
*single* one of the visits I've had (Yep,
`Matt <http://www.offlineblog.com/mildillson/>`__ and
`Amy <http://lashingtail.blogspot.com/>`__, that means you don't have to
feel guilty about anything -- that's the highlight of the week, so far.
Glad you liked the new toy!) but I am *so* goddamned tired at this point
-- I'm loving seeing people that I don't get to see often enough, but
the strain of being sociable so much in so short of a time is just...
too much.

I look forward to the weekend, because to a greater or lesser extent, my
family kind of understands my need to just... hide, sometimes. It'll be
great. I'm bringing a huge pile of books (thanks again, Amy!).

On the "other parts of life" front... Nope, nothing. My job rocks, and
that's about it.
