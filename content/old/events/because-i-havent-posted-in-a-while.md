\... and [this](http://www.tjcenter.org/past2004.html) ("The Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression") is nifty.

A free speech advocacy group in the USA hands out these Jefferson Muzzle awards to organizations and individuals who have failed to grasp the first ammendment protections of free speech over the course of the year. A good read, and a set of good examples to use if discussing free speech and its abuses.

(Not found via [Mefi](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/32432), but certainly discussed there)
