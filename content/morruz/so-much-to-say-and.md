just no way to say it all. Trains planes and automobiles and boats and livestock, what a way to travel. By the way, lights while driving here are optional, headlights and signal lights. Crossing streets is an art. Lanes are optional.  
I am in Alexandria for those who care. This is a very arabic area but there is enough english around for me to survive. I'm actually quite pleased with my arabic and get complemented on it. If there is a media report of Hogan in Egypt it wasn't me.  
I don't know if you heard but there was a bomb in Cairo last night not too far from where we were having supper but I never saw anything, security went up a notch though.  
I'm liking the buying of supper while the seafood is still moving, they give you too much food.  
Great view of the mediteranean out of my hotel window right across the street.  
Take care all, moi
