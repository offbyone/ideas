So, tomorrow I\'m heading out, early in the morning, to get back in the saddle at [Eden North](http://www.edennorth.com/).

Anyone want in?

\### Update

Sadly, no jumping today, as the winds were too strong. Maybe tomorrow, although with rain forecasted all day, I\'m not hopeful. Worst case? Next weekend\...
