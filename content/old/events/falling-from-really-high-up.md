Further news on the skydiving scenario:

I have received the coupons promised me from [Eden North](http://www.edennorth.com/), and far from the trivial \$10-ish off that I was expecting (from a base price of \$185 per jumper) the coupons are for 20% off, dropping the price of a first jump to \$148 each. Which is significantly more reasonable, and I hope that this will persuade a few people who are waffling that this is a _really good idea_ (tm)
