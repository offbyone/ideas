I *have* had a few people ask me for ideas, so I figured I\'d just put them out here as a suggestion or three.

Yes, it\'s a swaglist. Sue me, it\'s my website.

(On a related note, by the way, [Char](http://www.livejournal.com/users/xraystar/) and [Simon](http://www.livejournal.com/users/vernondalhart/) will be getting posting setup at [Morruz](http://www.offlineblog.com/morruz) when they take off. So you\'ll all have to read it for *their* travels, too. I hope that Simon will post there, with a link over from his usual haunts, so that the travel docs can be kept together.)

Anyhoo.

So, there\'s a few techie things that I\'ll get out of the way ASAP. I\'m looking for a Microsoft *Bluetooth* (wireless) mouse. I\'m also looking for some kind of USB2 external hard drive in the medium-large range. Nothing insane. Last, but not least, I\'m interested in a couple of computer games. For Windows (sad, but I installed Windows on the laptop just this weekend. I\'m a sucker for techie playthings, what can I say). The games are HalfLife 2, and The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.

Heh.

Books are cool, too, of course. I\'m low on literature, despite [Amy](http://lashingtail.blogspot.com/)\'s best efforts to swamp me ;)

Anyway, that\'s about it for the technolust. I don\'t know why people keep saying I\'m hard to buy for, since I usually make it pretty clear what I want.
