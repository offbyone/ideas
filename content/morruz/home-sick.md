Well, the countdown has begun. I'm looking forward to comfy clothes and dinner on \*my\* time. I thought the Roses were bad, eating after 6pm! Also, something other than pastry for breakfast. I know that sounds awful, but it's true. I'm a protein girl, all the way

Carcassonne has been pretty cool so far, awesome, awesome guest house. everything is big here ;) the room, the scenery, the freaking castle. Wow. Mel and my prep has paid off I think, there have been no complaints in the leg department, and although there have been no Big Up Hill Hikes, I'm still thanking that prep cause I can tell when I walk up that I'm not even close to labouring The Pictures are all going to come up when we arrive home, since we're only here for a short while longer, and I think this will be the last internet cafe. We were (and are still considering) getting a reservation at a Micheline star restaurant tomorrow, so ...maybe we'll have something (expensive) and excititng to talk about when we get home. we'll let you know.

Some Highlights:  
Truffles, truffles, truffles, truffles. should I do a lottery, or just pick myself? who will it be, who will it be?  
In Avignion, I learned what foie gras was: Even I had a twinge of "Meanies!"  
And here, in Carcasonne, Chris has schooled me in medieval warfare, very interesting.  
I learned what gésiers are: I ordered a "salade au gésiers et artichauds" and, well, I got one of the wierdest salads ever. nice bed of greens, tomatoes, cuces, light dressing, spattering of artichokes, and 2 chickens worth of extra crispy super hot hearts and kidneys.  
I had a dream so bad, my hair turned white. (litterally just one of them)  
Watched a frenchman laugh at an englishman who tried to buy worschestershire sauce at his shop.  
Saw a muskrat so big I thought it was a Beaver  
Stepped in Dog shit  
Watched a great game of Bocci Ball  
Photographed a Nuclear Power Plant  
Made out in a 2 thousand year old structure at least once  
Went through a river lock twice  
Watched a mini lock once  
Bought Yarn :)
