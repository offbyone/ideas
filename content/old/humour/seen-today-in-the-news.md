I wish I had the memory required to make this a regular feature: I've been wanting to do periodic highlights of things I've seen in the news_paper\_ that chafed me, or amused me, or really need to be seen. However, the facts that I a) do not have an electronic Journal subscription and b) forget to post them by the time I get to a computer, have prevented this.

Until now.

Seen in the news today:

**UFOs hold key to climate: ex-minister**

In short, Paul Hellyer, a former defense minister under Lester Pearson, has called for governments around the world to disclose all alien technology that they've accumulated over the years from crashed UFOs, in order to resolve climate change.

Yay, democracy.
