Although you might not really understand the impact of this, it was reported today on various [geek](http://www.betanews.com/article/Death_Knell_Sounds_for_Nullsoft_Winamp/1100111204) [news](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/11/1348218&tid=120&tid=141) [sites](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/11/aol_axes_nullsoft/) that [Winamp](http://www.winamp.com/) is quietly slipping into oblivion, with Nullsoft having been shut down by AOL.

I'm feeling nostalgic about this. Winamp had been, until I got an iPod, the first non-driver piece of software that ever went on a new install of windows. For the longest time, it was synonymous with playing music, because it was fast, usable, simple, and it Just Worked. The only reason I ever stopped using it was the challenge of maintaining two separate libraries of music, with consistent ratings and genres, between it and iTunes.

Yeah, so I'm mourning software. I'm not the [worst](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6397274/) though, but it *is* pretty geeky.
