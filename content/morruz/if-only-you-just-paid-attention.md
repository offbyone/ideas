you would not have such a problem with the keyboard. You just have to pay a little attention and it is bnot really a problem.

So Chris and I showed up in Hiroshima and we took a walk, ate at a fantastic restaurant that was avout 180 square feet and had nothing legible on the menu, so we ordered "ramen" and got a fantastic dish, Yummmmy! And some Kirin to wash it down, which I'm sure you can discern is some american-available japanese beer.

We toured the peace park, and I got some really good pictures, whilch I will upload later, but I'm sure you will not be disapointed.

Tata!
