We´re here, 10:30 Tuesday and checked in at the same hostal in Valparaiso as last year. Somewhere around 30 and sunny.  
Couple neat things on the trip. Simon got us up and out, I hope you´re feeling better now. For those of you that know him, Tod Strynatka was right behind me at security in LA so we had a little chat. At LA we met a girl off our plane and were able to give her directions for her connecting flight. When we got to the LAN desk they were shutting down even tho our flight was not due to take off for 45 minutes but they let us in and then got the whole trickle of people off our same flight from Vancouver. All around an enjoyable, easy trip down. Oh and for those of you coming this way, the cabs at Santiago are a pack of hounds to get through.  
We plan on settling in here for a couple days then south bound.
