From when I sit now, it\'s only 22 hours before I can get my sorry ass back to town and into the welcoming arms of my lovely ladyfriend.

From when I sit now, it\'s only 42 hours until I start seeing friends I haven\'t gotten to socialize with in ages, or so it seems.

From when I sit now, it\'s only 54 hours until I get two whole days of straight non-work time, either spend puttering around the yard and house with the aforementioned lovely ladyfriend, or just communing with my beloved digital domain.

From when I sit now, it\'s only 104 hours til my bliss ends, and I return to work at 6 AM on Monday.

I think that the time shall be well spent. How about you folks? What\'s on tap for \_your\_ weekend?
