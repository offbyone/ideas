Woke up this morning having recovered nearly 100% from the partying last night. Sure, it was out of character for me, but every once in a while it pays to be a bit less moderate. Missed some people that should have been there, but all told a \[good time\](<http://www.livejournal.com/users/vernondalhart/112341.html>) was had.

The time was not so good this morning, however. I woke up to a clicking noise coming from my new hard drive (the one that \[Char\](<http://www.livejournal.com/users/xraystar>) bought me for my music) and essentially a dead drive with little to no hope of recovery.

Except\...

I take the damnable piece of cack back to \[BCom\](<http://www.bcom.ab.ca/>) and they check it out and it works fine there. So I bring it home, and lo and behold, it works like a damned charm!

I\'m not too trusting of it at this point, though, which tells me that maybe \-- dud or no \-- I need to investigate a newer drive. I\'m starting to think that it\'s gonna end up being a problem elsewhere in the PC \--it\'s plausible that the hard drive controller itself is b0rked. Not a happy thought, that.
