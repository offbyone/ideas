Wow, is my french rusty. Like, decaying post-communist state rusty.

But it'll do.

We're going to France!

So, I've spent quite a bit of time (and money!) on the phone the last couple of days, trying to line up the hotel for the main part of our trip. Last night, the last pieces fell in to place; we're set for transportation, housing, and pretty much everything else, now all we have to do is *get* there. September 4th can't get here soon enough!

We'll be doing a few pretty cool things: An overnight ferry ride on the Mediterranean, a week on Corsican beaches, probably the Moulin Rouge in Paris... All told, it's going to be something special.

We'll be updating as we go. Welcome to Morruz2008!
