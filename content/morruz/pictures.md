Okay, this is a test, my first time doing this, so hopefully it works. Here are some pictures of our rafting trip:

<div class="g2image_float_left">

<wpg2id>3392</wpg2id>

</div>

<div class="g2image_float_right">

<wpg2id>3397</wpg2id>

</div>

This was from the first waterfall we went down, a height of 4 1/2 meters, and the next picture in the series (which i have yet to upload) shows that me and the girl behind me both fell out of the boat on this one. When I have the next picture, I'll add it cause it's a good one, you can see one of our legs up in the air amid the crashing waves!

Tons of fun.
