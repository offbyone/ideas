Jebus.

So, \[Char\](<http://xraystar.livejournal.com/>) and I needed to do some last-minute stocking-stuffer shopping last night, and in what I figured was a bit of inspired wisdom we figured to beat the worst of the daytime crowds and hit the big-box beast at 1 AM.

Oh, man. What a \_mistake\_.

I think that the fact that Wal-Mart was busier than I\'ve ever seen it, \_at 1:00 in the morning\_, is probably a sign of the end times. When I got there, the store was borderline unnavigable. The aisles were full to the brim with shoppers, many of whom were wider than their carts (no joke! I counted at least twenty women whose hind ends fit firmly into the \"charged for two seats on planes until obesity was ruled to be a disability, and now are among the \'conveniently-parked\' crowd\" category in the checkout line alone, forget the woman who was walking through the toy section distorting spacetime and pressing the noisemaker button on a toy in her cart \_over and over and over and over and over and over\...\_ again.

Madness has come to us.

Anyway, I got what I needed \-- I think. And now I\'m done shopping, lesson learned.

Bah.

Humbug.

;)
