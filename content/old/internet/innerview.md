He's not ordinarily my cup of tea, so to speak \-- he's too much about how the black man's got a shitty life because whitey rules the roost, even now \-- but this [interview with Chris Rock](http://www.theonionavclub.com/feature/index.php?issue=4046) at "The Onion":http://www.theonion.com/ is still a good read, and it does leave me with a fair amount of respect for the way he approaches his art.

Now, of course this automatically runs into my belief that you can never really know actors. I mean, less so than other people. They're _actors_, they create themselves for a living. But if this is a true statement of who he is, I have to say I'd probably like him.
