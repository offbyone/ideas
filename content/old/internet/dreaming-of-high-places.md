I want to direct any of my readers with even a passing interest in space to the [Highlift Systems](http://www.highliftsystems.com/) website. This is a private organization that is looking for ways to make a space elevator feasible. Im my view, if we are ever going to take more than baby steps into space, this is how it\'ll have to be done, so these guys are fairly interesting to me. Go check them out! (Discussion on [Slashdot](http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/02/17/0045205&mode=thread&tid=160) and [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/23622))

And damn, it would be fine to work in this field when i get out of school\... I wonder\...

On an off-topic note, can i get a show of postings from people about the links off to the right? The random quote, random link, comics, etc? Are they of interest to you at all? Any suggestions, etc?
