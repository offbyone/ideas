/me blows the dust off

Wow. That's gotta be a record.

I couldn't say why I've been so blas√© about the whole 'blog' thing the last while. I've just had little to say, and less inclination to spew random junk onto the web.

So, in a sense trying to get back into the swing of things, here's something fascinating I found on Metafilter today: \[Coping with Autism\](<http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~alistair/survival/>). It's a bullet-pointed self-help guide for people with autism that offers an interesting insight into what differs in their approach to the world. Autism is one of those things that fascinates me, as something that is not _quite_ a disability, but is often viewed as one.

Anyway, hope you all find this interesting.
