Just a brief aside\... having seen this twice now (Both with the same company) I can [not]{#not}\_ get over the bizarre juxtaposition between the cutesy CGI-ish ferret creatures and the [movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_for_a_Dream) for which this song was [written](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Mansell).

See [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP4mgObDeUU&hl=en&fs=1)

Seriously, WTF.
