I think that tomorrow I'll just ... avoid .. the internet. The place
turns into a pile of utter shit once per year, on 1 April, as every
two-bit dumb shit gets the mistaken impression that we all just stop
caring about anything at all, and decides that pink site redesigns and
fake album releases are actually *funny*.

Asshats.
