My god, are people twits.

\[MeFi\](<http://www.metafilter.com/>) just acquired a small add on its front page, containing no nudity, for \[SuicideGirls.com\](<http://www.suicidegirls.com/>), a softcore spooky-girl porn site (that link is **not** safe for work, if you're wondering!).

The \[reaction\](<http://metatalk.metafilter.com/mefi/8942>) has been just stupid, though. Comments like "Sadly, because of these ads, I can no longer recommend MetaFilter to anyone" ([link](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/mefi/8942#196100)) and "It is wrong for you to take porn ad money. What a sorry day for this site." ([link](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/mefi/8942#196081)) have, well, tweaked me in an ungood kind of way.

I am currently receiving a talk on why I should not be angry at this. I disagree, respectfully, but be aware that in the House of Chris there are dissenting opinions.
