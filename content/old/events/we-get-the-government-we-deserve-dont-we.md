As should be [known](http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2004/06/29/canada/elxn_wrap040629) by now, Canadians have spoken, and what they've said is, essentially, "Please, sir, can I have some more?"

Faugh.

With everything that has come to light about the workings of the Liberal party in this country, we as a nation chose to re-elect a party led by a man who hides his own companies in offshore tax shelters. We chose to re-elect a party that has demonstrated itself incapable of being honest towards its electorate. We chose -- for the _fourth time running_ -- a party that has broken more campaign promises than some parties even _make_ (GST, anyone?)

We truly do get the government we deserve.

Here's to more of the same.
