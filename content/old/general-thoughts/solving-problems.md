This won't mean much to any of you, but with a bit of finagling I've managed to come up with a reasonably well thought out solution to a problem that has vexed me at work, having to do with porting a logging toolkit from C, where it has been working well for years, to Java where our new development is being done.

It's not perfect, but it's a big step up.

Now, of course, it must survive the peer review process, but that's another story.
