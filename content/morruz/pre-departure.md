To all of you who regularly check this site with bated breath hoping and praying that we will once again be out of the country for some time, well, wait no-longer (okay, a couple more days). Yes, Dad and I will be crossing the equator and returning for the third year in a row to lovely South America. This post is mostly a heads up that the site is once again active and also a tester to feature some of the new quirks that Chris has set up for us, mostly in the form of easier picture viewing and all that good stuff. So expect to be hearing lots from us over the next seven weeks!
