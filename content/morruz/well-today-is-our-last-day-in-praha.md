I've got all the things I need, even the tablecloth, which cost me five bucks. oooh.

We saw more fantastic opera last night, and our collective date was a proffesional opera singer, Doctor Doktor. So we got an interesting bit of... class?? I'm not sure how to put it. And tonight, we are getting the last one in, and it's supposed to be the best we will see here, Carmen. I'm thinning out my supplies, giving up showering so I have more room for stuff, since I don't want to buy an other bag if I don't have to.

Well, this will be my second last post... I'm trying not to spend 200\$ on glasses......
