I've stumbled upon more than a couple of decent shots at Tolkien-related
humour in the last few days, so i figured i'd share them with you all.
Of course, most of the people reading my site are familiar with the
`*very* secret diaries <http://home.nyu.edu/~amw243/diaries/>`__ kept by
the Fellowship on their journey. What you may not have seen is the two,
and soon to be more, new ones that have been recovered and posted to a
livejournal - They are
`Aragorn's <http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=cassieclaire&itemid=21484>`__
and
`Theoden's <http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?journal=cassieclaire&itemid=22029>`__.
Hey, if the content bothers you, just be glad it's not `Slash
fiction <http://www.femgeeks.net/tolkien/archive.html>`__. (NSFW; `What
is 'Slash'? <http://members.aol.com/RtNicholas/private/what.htm>`__)
(Basically, that last link is so that people don't claim i sent them
without warning.)

Also of note is a posting on `/. <http://slashdot.org/>`__ pointing out
"What if someone else had written Tolkien?" to fairly amusing effect.
There are such luminaries as Hemingway and T. Pratchett amongst the
hypothetical writers. Though the `originating
page <http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?s=ce24f67f4391402642140618dcde1e00&threadid=138905&perpage=50&pagenumber=1>`__
is currently down for the count, having been
`slashdotted <http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/slashdot-effect.html>`__
into oblivion, a kind poster
`duplicated <http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=49969&cid=5031644>`__
most, if not all, of the entries posted.

And, finally, for people who're tired of it all, i direct you to the
`Tolkien Sarcasm Page <http://flyingmoose.org/tolksarc/tolksarc.htm>`__.
Don't be a stranger, now!
