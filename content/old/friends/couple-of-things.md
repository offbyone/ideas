Well, it\'s been a few days, and persuant to my resolution to post more, here\'s one.

Items of note:

| - I\'ve just bombed a \[Cmput 340\](<http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/courses/Cmput340.php>) midterm, or at least I\'m pretty sure I did. That course is raping my mind, it\'s just not as easy as I had hoped (given my knack for numbers) that it would be.
| - I\'m getting up to speed in \[Cmput 391\](<http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/courses/Cmput391.php>) now, mostly as a consequence of paying attention in class. I had my head up my ass at the beginning of the term, and I seem to have gotten it out.
| - \[Char\](<http://xraystar.livejournal.com>) and I are going to be making our way down to Mexico this coming week. This will slow posting down to a crawl, for reasons that should be obvious to anyone. It\'s not as far south as the dad and sister are (Miss you guys!) but it\'s a step. 33 degree weather! Ech :). Still, since I have to bring homework with me, I\'m not as relaxed as I could be. It\'ll be nice to get away, though.
| - New look to the site, if you didn\'t notice :)
| - DietFilter: \[Aaron\](<http://www.spaz.ca/>) has been raving about a Calorie-Reduced diet that he\'s on. It seems like a lot of work, but it also seems to be backed by real science. I have to admit, it might be an argument from authority, but I\'m pretty curious. I wonder if I\'d have the willpower to do it?

If anything else comes up, of course I\'ll post about it.
