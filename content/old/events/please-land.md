Today, a third nation [joined the US and USSR](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=514&e=4&u=/ap/20031015/ap_on_sc/china_space) in the very exclusive group of spacefaring nations.

I disagree with China in so many things, from both political and ethical positions. But, i cannot help but feel immense respect for them as they take this important step into their own future.

I hope that Lt. Col. Yang Liwei lands safely at the end of his flight and that they continue to pursue this course. If they do, it will hopefully act as a goad, driving the space program in the US forward.

Perhaps now, in the same spirit that drove them during the cold war, the US will finally start putting money into space again. I can dream, can\'t i?
