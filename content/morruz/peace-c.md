Char and I toured the Hiroshima Peace Park and Victim Memorial yesterday, and it was... sobering.

Much like the concentration camp at Dachau, although different in many fundamental ways, this park memorializes an episode in history that must not ever be forgotten; I am not a believer that peace is the only way, nor do I have a blanket condemnation for all nuclear weapons, but the consequences of their use are so dire that I believe that people who use them should be obligated to know, and *understand*, the nature of the wounds they cause before ever they release them.

Also: Dined in a nook in the business district of Hiroshima on a bowl of *something*, wandered a four-storey computer store, and shot the shit with a dutch investment banker, a british programmer and an australian... talker.

It's been an interesting hostel stay.
