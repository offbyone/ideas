## Update
Support requests can now be filed at [my support site](http://offby1.no-ip.org:8080)

Please use the appropriate project, and _leave a valid e-mail address_ or don't expect a lot of action.

A warning: Don't write in a way that may be construed as spammy -- maybe the best way would be to leave a one-line request for support and your e-mail address in the field, which will _not_ be shown. I will then respond and ask what you need.

Thanks, and I apologize for the hoops, but 10+ spam/day, even using gmail, was too much for me.
