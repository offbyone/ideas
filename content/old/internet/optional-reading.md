On a significantly lighter note, here's a place you can go when you run out of books to read:

\[ReadMe\](<http://mssv.net/wiki/index.php/ReadMe>)

This is a wiki collecting a significant fraction of the \[Ask Metafilter\](<http://ask.metafilter.com/>) questions pertaining to suggested books.

I fear this list\... It means I'll be nose-deep in books soon. I've been expanding my reading tastes a bit lately, and this is only going to push that harder.
