Wow. I\'d never have believed it, given the fairly-sedentary nature of a software Con, but this is bloody tiring.

I\'m bone-tired, mentally-exhausted, and nicely sated with knowledge and networking. It\'s been a great time. The wind-down, today, results in a shorter day (ends at 5 PM, instead of at 10:00) although that just means that I\'m likely to end up dodging out to dinner with some of the people from the Foundation and from IBM that I\'ve met.

Anyway, it\'s been worth it. Now, of course, when I get home I have a metric ton of catching up to do. School, work, bugs, issues, a sick girlfriend, an irritating cat\...

I miss it :)
