If only the north american ads would be like [this](http://www.playingsafely.co.uk/12stisofchristmas/12-STIs.html). The URL really _looks_ like it's legit, and this has got to be the funniest/sickest public service announcement i have _ever_ seen.

So, if PSA(Public Service Announcements)s were always like this, do you think people would listen more?
