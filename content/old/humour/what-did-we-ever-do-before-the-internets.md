A friend of my co-worker, call him \"A\", is the subject of this post.

On Canada Day, \"A\" was stabbed.

\"A\" is a chef, by trade.

Odds are good that \"A\" will be receiving one of [these](http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/gear/86dd/), delivered to him more-or-less anonymously.

Life is full of the funny, sometimes.
