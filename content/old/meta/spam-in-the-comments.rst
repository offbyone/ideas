Although the offenses in question have more or less confined themselves
to entries farther down the homepage, I've been getting spammed a few
times a week, on *my own website*! However, it seems that i'm not the
only one, and a few other people are mad as hell `and don't intend to
take it anymore <http://kalsey.com/2003/11/comment_spam_manifesto/>`__.

It seems that, through some strange agency, my site now actually has
enough incoming links to qualify it as a search engine ratings booster.
Kind of a backhanded compliment from spammers, i guess.

See, the thing is, at this stage, i'm getting probably ~10-15 pcs of
spam per day. This is just in my private mail account, forget the amount
of crap i see throughout the rest of my browsing. At this point, the
only thing keeping my inbox usable - in the face of not only said spam,
but also high-volume mailing lists - is the fact that i now handle my
own mail server. I can't imagine how useless e-mail is to people without
this benefit. How do you handle it?
