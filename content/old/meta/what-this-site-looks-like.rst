God DAMN, differing CSS implementations piss me off. To those of you
using a standards-compliant browser (ie: not IE), this site should look
\*pretty\* decent. Not great, but there shouldn't be any glaring
foulups. I hope. For the rest of you, in the majority who use IE to view
websites, i'm working on it. Please, bear with me. And, if you think you
can help me (as in, you have much more experience with CSS that i do -
that's not hard) please, drop me a line.
