First and foremost, I´d like to thank Christopher for the idea of this blog and then setting it up for us.

Traffic, basically there are no yield signs here, very few traffic lights and almost no stop signs yet does traffic ever flow well, basically, yield to traffic froim the right and give it.  The only jaywalking law probably reads ´just don´t get run over´.  Watching parrallel parking is fun, I liked the one this morning to do it into the double parked lane.

Thank you to Morris for preventing the theft of my camera, sharp girl her.

Trans Siberian railway, Petra and Rico did it recently.  Stops, getting off and on, raise the price.  Hotels are expensive (another swede says up to \$40 a night) but food can be bought cheaply at any railway platform, only what they have at that time.  You can get along in english but some russian makes it easier, especially knowing the letters of the alphabet.  We do have their eddress so can ask more questions.  Trans Mongolian is recommended as is a visit to St. Petersburg, Moscow is boring.

Yesterday, what can I say, a nice trip to the Chilean border on the old route, elevation 4400m at the summit, 1100m in the last 8km.  We saw the tallest and 2nd tallest mountains in america.  THEN, somehow we were invited to share a barbeque with our hostel owners.  Done Argentinian style on their patio (read small area on the roof), burn wood down to embers and cook over them.  Vacuna and chorizo, wow, wow and wow.  Miranda was great at keeping me in a conversation with a family of 3 spanish speakers and fun was had by all.

Anyway, hopefully today we´ll actually visit a bodega.

Ciao, moi
