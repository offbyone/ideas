Two articles in the Wall Street Journal, one titled \[Are We Teaching Our Kids To Be Fearful of Men?\](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118782905698506010.html?mod=Moving-On>) and its sequel, \[Avoiding Kids: How Men Cope With Being Cast as Predators\](<http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB118903209653018615.html>).

I'm just going to let these speak for themselves.

Found via \[MetaFilter\](<http://www.metafilter.com/64673/Avoiding-Kids-How-Men-Cope-With-Being-Cast-as-Predators>).
