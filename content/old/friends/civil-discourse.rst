Had a great time chatting w/ Matt D. last night, for those of you that
know him, you'll understand why - he's one of the few people with whom i
can disagree on issues ranging from healthcare to general philosophy,
and still have a debate that actually feels like it serves a purpose;
his opinions spur thought for me, and it seems to me that he also
considers mine. Not something that i see very often.

He and Amy have great friends, too. Having only met Rod and Scheherazade
the one time previously, at a movie, i had never really had a chance to
talk to either of them. Now that i have, i am quite impressed with both
of them, they come off as really interesting folks. I hope that i will
get to see more of them in times to come... Assuming, of course, that i
stay in a sociable mode ;)

Anyway, i don't really have anything else to day, except **damn**
skydiving is great!
