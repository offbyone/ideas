Holy crap. I was in at 7:45 yesterday, and out at 11:30 (thereby *completely* missing Char, all day long). And today, well, I'm already in at work :)

We've got a big demo this morning for the business folks at a large American financial company, and I've been hacking at the demo all week and a chunk of last week, trying to get it into shape to show off. And, as long as my days have been, they've been as nothing to those of our web designer and web programmer, who have made amazing things happen in a short, short time.

It's been fun, but I look forward to winding down for an hour or three.

Is it a good, or bad, sign when you think about work even on your days off? Meaning, "Hm. I wonder if I could fix with \...?"

Heh.
