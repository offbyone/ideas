Yesterday we headed south from Santiago.  From there to Chillan, about 4.5 hours bus, its a lush, very flat, valley full of orchards and food crops, a real big bread basket area.  The mountains were visible to the east and I saw two volcanoes, one of which I'm sure was active.  From Chillan to Conception is mountainous with major tree farming as it's industry.  Most days we are seeing sun and 30 plus temperatures although at the coast we seem to get cloudy mornings also.

I worked out last night that at the cost of living down here I could already retire here and live quite well but if I work another two years I could live real well, maid and all.

As Miranda posted, Antartica is likely out unless some surprise comes up, its not worth it at this time so soon, off to the lake district.
