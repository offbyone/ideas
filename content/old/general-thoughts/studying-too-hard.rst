Char informs me that i have an interesting habit. When, as often
happens, i fall asleep before she does, apparently when she finally
turns off the lights, i tend to roll over and hug her in my sleep,
occasionally mumbling something semi-coherent.

Last night, she tells me that i rolled over, wrapped my arms around her,
and in a tone that she describes as "seductive", i said: "I want to
remove your exponents and solve your equation."
