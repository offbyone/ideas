Midterms - the first pass of them, at any rate - are done. Woo!

Just polished off the CMPT272 midterm this afternoon, in a manner of speaking. This marks the first time that i can remember that i failed to finish an exam. It's kind of a weird feeling, but since i'm far from the only one, ie: the whole class, not to finish, i don't feel quite so bad. I get the impression that there wasn't really a great expectation that the exam *could* be finished in the time allotted, and i expect we'll be marked accordingly. I hope :)

Other than that, Chem, CMPT115, Math, etc, are done\... Marks are 90+ for the latter two, 82 for the former. Tolerable :/
