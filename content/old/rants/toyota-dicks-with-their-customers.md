As discussed \"here\":http://www.livejournal.com/users/xraystar/16589.html and elsewhere on the same site, Toyota is messing with my Charling\'s head over the cost of her car.

Since it seems that they won\'t be letting up any time soon, and we\'d really like to get this buggerload of crap off of our mental plates ASAP, can anyone in the crowd suggest anything to do, other than the obvious consumer reporters for local TV stations things?

This is making Char\'s life hard, something of which I strongly disapprove, so personally I\'d love to see it fixed sooner rather than later.
