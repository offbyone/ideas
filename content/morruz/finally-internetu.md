Well, a very welcome - if completely foreign, but I'm learning slowly - keyboard is in front of me, and I could only be happier if Chris was on google chat, but you guys probably don't need to be hearing about that...

Anyway, Simon and I have been so busy - my feet have passed from sore to numb, I now see how women wear heels all the time, really after about 3 days, you just can't feel your feet anymore. We§ve done the opera 3 times in Praha, and a concert on one other night, as well as catching a great local Jazz band (4 piece with a freakin' banjo! it was awesome!)

The train ride to Brno was gorgeous, I have to admit, being in the city is hard for me to get used to on a vacation. Seeing (and hearing and smelling) green was so welcome! This is a very interesting city aesthetically. It could easily be described as ugly, since it is old and run down (it hasn't benifited from the government grants that Praha has for restoration after the communist let it detiriorate) and there is evidence of it's industrious nature with large smoke stacks reminiscent of (what I picture as) nuclear power facilities. After all, it is a very important industrial city for CR.

We ended up using an accomodation service when we arrived, and it turns out it is a private home! It has a BATHTUB!! OMG!! I'm buying bubble bath after this. The balcony (yes, you heard right) looks right onto the old town square, but unfourtunately it is under construction, so it's not as great of a view as it could be. Still. It's pretty swank. It's not Mendel's Monestary (it is only open as a hostel from July to September), but hey, I'll take it. That is the claim to fame for Brno - this is where the famous geneticist did all his reaserch, just a block from the town square.

Simon got to witness something as amazing as Mendel's reaserch: I, Charlotte, looked in a shop window found a dress I've been looking for all year, tried it on, it fit, I bought it, and I left the store. Can you believe it???? I'm amazed too. On a slightly sideways note, I think this is where I am going to do all my shopping. I've already found a pair of shoes........yeah for VISA!

OK, now that I've inundated you, I'll let your eyes rest. Simon and I are going to the Ballet tomorrow night, we will see Swan Lake. Apparently Praha isn't the only Czech city that enjoys the arts. I suppose this was the capital of Moravia at one point, and they had to have a Divaldo as well.....

Na Schledanou!

Eight!
