My god... Apparently the powers that be at new line cinema have decided
to grant my fondest wish about LOTR: `Theatrical, all-day
marathon <http://www.lordoftherings.net/trilogy/index.html>`__ of the
*extended versions* of the first two movies, followed immediately by the
first screening of The Return of the King.

Only downside? No theatres in Edmonton on that list yet... Who wants to
start lobbying with me? I'm **so** all over that!
