Sorry, i know i haven't been posting anything. I'm busily working at
school and with Telus, and it's really damned draining. Between the long
hours at work and the long hours at school, i barely get any time to
myself, which means i'm less communicative than i should be.

Hope things are well for the lot of you - updates will follow soon, once
midterms are more over.
