All in all, the trip was fun. Chris and I had a truly wonderful time together. France did not wow me like any other place I'd been, or leave me with any really potent memories like other trips I've taken, and I'd likely not go back, but if I had to do it again, I would wholeheartedly. I loved the time with Chris. I love that we made what we did of it. I love that despite where I am and how I feel, I'm comfortable with him, and we can make the most of any given experience, whatever the expectations are.
