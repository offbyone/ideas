Sitting here, alternating between idle web browsing, reading Amber novels, and dozing on the couch\...

My life is pretty easy this weekend, despite the lingering aftereffects of a nasty cold that I've had all week that has left me with headaches, poor sleep, and a sense that the world is passing me by in a grey haze. I got some housework done, although not too much. I'm lazy, after all.

In school-related news, I'm working on a Perl CGI app for an assignment. It means that I get to write code in what is effectively a write-only language \-- Perl is legendarily difficult to read \-- and generally do a bunch of web-hackery in an old-fashioned sort of tool. I'm more of a Java fan, myself, but this does the trick, I guess.

I didn't get to go jumping today, because the fog outside combined with a sense that I needed to get some laundry done to keep me home.

I want to *build* something, damn it \-- I want to have a project to put together that has a defined scope, a real purpose, and is small enough that I can make a realisitic start to it. I had idle dreams of remaking a game, but I'm not that hardcore, and can't be arsed to *become* that hardcore. My other project ran up against limitations in the known information about the iTunes library format. All of which leave me with a periodic need to *have* an itch to scratch.

Grr.
