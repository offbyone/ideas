Oh, man, it's been a while.

Yeah, I'm still here.

I've been working on school a lot, and work \-- I'm pretty stressed these days, and my time is at a premium, so I haven't been writing as often as I want to. I'll try to remedy that, but this won't be the post that does ;)

To all of my assorted friends, book time while you can! :)
