Kind of a sum-up, here.

I've been busy at work, putting together some interesting bits of design on configuration and deployment of one part of our application. I've been pulled in about three different directions, lately, so it's been a bit hard to decide what needs doing.

I really do like it there.

School is.. well, let's just put it this way \-- once I get back from Peggy's place this weekend, it's to the books for me, and no mistake \--I'm slipping, and I need to get my shit together.

As noted before, delays in getting my new laptop. I'm getting antsy, because I have to somehow have this thing sort of under control by the time I take it to EclipseCon in late March, and at this rate I'll get it mere days before.

Faugh.

All told, not a lot to report. I'm tired, this week, and somewhat cranky, but I'm getting by. I've been reading a ton, and bit by bit cataloguing my books on [LibraryThing](http://www.librarything.com/). You should all try it \-- it's great!

Anyway, that's all for now.
