Oh, *god* how I hate the verbal abortion that is gamer-speak. All aspects, facets, wrinkles, and sides. Every form and nuance -- to the extent that *nuance* is a valid adjective -- fills me with anger and disgust.

I would like to find the person who first moved this term from the relatively-obscure backwoods of the internet and into spoken language, and assault them with a degree of force precisely matched to the force of their assault upon what was, if not perfect, a perfectly serviceable language.
