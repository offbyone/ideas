I just stumbled on an interesting [essay on cheating](http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/InDefenseOfCheating.html) by the author of the [Design of Everyday Things](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/dt/assoc/tg/aa/xml/assoc/-/0465067107/qid%3D1073925345/schoolblog-20/002-2782151-0670423), Don Norman.

Essentialy it\'s a (valid) argument that grading would work better if it weren\'t there at all, and instead peoples\' schoolwork would be better categorized by their abilities - be they \"Leader\", \"Scholar\", \"Seeker of information\" etc\...

Anyway, you get the idea.

So, how would this work? Does anyone have any other ideas about this? How about any teachers reading this\...

Okay, odds are slim, but still :)
