I'd like to hear some feedback on the new look, before i rip apart all the comment pages and clean them up as well - how does this design suit? Is it easy to read, easy on the eyes, etc?

Bear in mind, i'm a fledgling web designer at best, so please treat me with kid gloves accordingly.

Big shoutouts to Simon for the invaluable help on this pass.
