There\'s an \"article (What part of no do ya still not understand?)\":http://www.laweekly.com/ink/03/53/features-lewis.php on the LA Weekly site taking about the current thoughts - from a wide social perspective - on the date rape issue.

It makes a few fairly strong points, and is nearly unique in the articles i\'ve read in that it actually goes so far as to suggest that there are situations where responsibility should be taken by the victim in this sort of situation.

Now, before anyone gets all up in arms at me, realize this: \_I hate the idea of rape\_. It is, as far as i can tell, the only truly inexcusable crime, and the suggestion that the victim may have borne some responsibility is in no way intended to suggest that the rapist involved should take less blame, or a lighter punishment. But there are a few good points to remember in this article.

We have reached a point in the sexual environment where women are taking control of their sexual persons. They blog about it. They party naked on video. They \_know\_ the risks, and be damned if it\'s suggested that they can\'t take care of themselves. And i, for one, am inclined to agree. The average woman is not stupid - well, no more stupid than the average man. And if someone seems to be \"off\" or not quite safe, any sensible person knows to get the hell out. To quote the article linked above: \"It didn\'t take a Ph.D. to figure out that going alone to Tyson\'s room at 2:30 a.m. was an imprudent thing to do,\"

So where does this go? I mean, we live in a society where someone who felt that she didn\'t get enough commitment the day after can \"accuse her partner of rape (Thanks, Dan Savage)\":http://www.thestranger.com/2001-11-29/savage.html - see the letter from NYCG.

Now, note from the article just cited that the incident was still a nasty one, but i agree with the conclusions drawn from it. Sometimes situations happen - where the victimizer is in the wrong, and clearly so, just again to be clear - where the victim needed to take a bit more into their own hands.
