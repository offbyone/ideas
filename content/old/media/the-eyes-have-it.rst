Here's one following up on my concerns about `digital image
manipulation <http://homepage.mac.com/gapodaca/digital/digital.html>`__.

The gist of it seems to be the small differences - not one of them
seemingly significant in and of itself - that add up to create a far
different impression on the viewer.

And this power is, well, in the hands of every kiddie that ever
downloaded photoshop.

This is scary.
