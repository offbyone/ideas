Having an attack *of* confidence is great.

I checked my mark rankings in CS 313 yesterday, and discovered that \--contrary to my expectations \-- I\'m #6 in the class of 35. It\'s still not great, but it\'s tolerable. So I feel better about that.

I\'ve had a week to poke around at my [new toy](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro), and I must say, I like it. It\'s fast, it\'s pretty, and it has a nice set of tools that just\... work. Video playback is still a work in progress, but I already knew that.

Looks good, though.

In other news, the [travelers](http://offlineblog.com/morruz/) are returning soon. We\'re looking forward to having them back.

[Char](http://www.livejournal.com/users/xraystar)\'s mom is visiting.

\'bout it, really.
