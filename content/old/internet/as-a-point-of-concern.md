Since most of you that read this blog are using Windows (but not all, of course), this is of interest to you: There is an [exploit](http://it.slashdot.org/it/06/01/01/1550258.shtml?tid=220&tid=218) for windows that works by, well, someone sending you an instant message. Seriously. Yes, I know there\'ve been hoaxes about this before, but this one is a bit more serious.

It remains to be seen what happens today when the business PCs of the world come back online, but I just ask that you be cautious with MSN instant messenger today. [Trillian](http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/) is a good alternative, one that I\'ve bought a license for (although as a [non-windows](http://www.ubuntulinux.org/) user, I can\'t really *use* it anymore), so I can recommend it without reservations.

If you\'re interested, details can be found on the [original Microsoft advisory](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/912840.mspx).

Also, note that this is not an IE-only flaw. Firefox users can still run into it, although it might be a bit more obvious that it\'s happening. *This is rumour, only*, so take it with a grain of salt, but I\'m hearing rumbles that it might be possible. Just be careful, and update your A/V.
