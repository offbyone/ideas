So, i can't really quote my math mark, cos it doesn't count, and i don't get the midterm for it back until later today, but my Chem101 marks are in for both midterms, and i'm sitting at a 92.2% average. Not too shabby, all told\...

CMPT114 is at 95.5%

English is somewhere around 80. So, it seems i might actually be cut out for this "school" thing after all. Woohoo!
