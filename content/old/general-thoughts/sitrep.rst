Well, it's been a bit; I'm not sure why, but I've been undermotivated to
blog lately, which has resulted in an ominous quiet from the site.

Here's a bullet-point update on my situation these days:

| \* I'm biking to work pretty much daily now; it's about (I'm told) 6km
  each way, so it's a bit of exercise I wouldn't otherwise be getting,
  and it's pretty decent exercise. It's excellent that our workplace has
  a shower.
| \* I'm taking class in the morning and working late, which means that
  anyone that wants to make plans with me has to take into account that
  I won't be home until 7:30 or so each weekday. Having said that, I'd
  love to do evening things with people, so please call any time.
| \* Work is up & down; I want to work on new things, but old things
  keep cropping up.
| \* Char is away this week, and I miss her.
| \* [XBMC](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/) is the greatest thing since
  sliced bread. No AppleTV for me, my new (old) Xbox does everything I
  would want the aTV to do.
| \* I've read a few books recently, notably "Infidel" by Ayaan Hirsi
  Ali, which I bought for Char. It's excellent, and I highly recommend
  it.
| \* On Sunday, with the blessings of Lyal and the qualified non-refusal
  of a shoulder surgeon, I'm going to fly again.
