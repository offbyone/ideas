Although we already pay a levy on our blank media under the assumption
that we will illegally copy media, thereby -- under the law of the land
-- rendering such copying legal, it seems that some segments of our
lawmaking bodies wish to [strip this right from
us](http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1118271756635\_30/?hub=CTVNewsAt11).

Which is, regrettably, not surprising in the least.

Feh. Just thought I'd pass that on, as well as a link to [Digital
Copyright Canada](http://www.digital-copyright.ca/), a blog focusing on
those kinds of issues. Worth keeping an eye on, if only for the
occasional sense of outrage.

In other news, this week I completed the first runs of the application
controller that I've been working on. My boss is in the process of
adding new functionality all over the place, but at least he has time to
help me out whenever I make my thrice-plus-daily visits to his office.
All in all, it's been a satisfying week, although I'm alone for the
weekend, as [Char](http://xraystar.livejournal.com) is out camping with
some friends for the next two days.
