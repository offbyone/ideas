So, I've spent the last few days with S&J just hanging around Bangor. They live on top of one hill and high street is at the bottom so a lot of up and down, good food, good visit, its time to let them be.  
Tomorrow I start the journey home, staying somewhere near London then catch an early plane across the water. I can tell you that this was all in all quite an experience but I'm going to be glad to put my feet up and suffer through Aries and Peanut again. I guess that in about a year I probably will have the bug again, anybody?
