So, Avignon has been awesome so far! I think I would reccomend even bypassing all other stops and just staying in Provence for an entire holliday. The town of Arles we visited yesterday still has it's Coluseum, whose building was *finished* in the First century, and still it's "downtown" is from the 5th century. Much of Avignon is the same, but without the coluseum, and in stead the Pallais des Papes, which, I did get guilted into seeing. Damn Chris and his Catholicism rubbing off on me. Well, actually, I like his catholicism rubbing off on me . . .

Ahem, sorry my mother reads this blog, I should be more discreet :)

The Landscape is Beautiful, I've taken a million photos, So many, in fact, that I need to upload them so I can take more :/ Last night, there was a fireworks display I will let Chris describe, since I can only describe what it smelled and sounded like, as a late France Day Celebration (it's about 3 months late, since their day is Col's Birthday, the 14th of July) But it was some history day. (all museums were free, for example)

Today Chris and I are going to take it easy, window shopping and walking around the town ramparts and taking in the old, old sights. Maybe drink some fine wine, and maybe have a lesson on drinking wine in the Giftshop of the Palais des Papes.
