Apparently, although this is news to me, March 15th has become the
"`International Eat an Animal for
PETA <http://www.yourish.com/archives/2005/mar6-12_2005.html#2005030803>`__"
day. (Via [Instapundit](http://instapundit.com/archives/021657.php))

It doesn't have the same linguistic flair that, say, Talk Like a Pirate
day does, but it's still something that I'll approve of. Apparently,
joined by many others, although most of them have left the blogging
thing -- or at least re-done their links -- since they participated, so
no links.

I guess this stems from an ad campaign that PETA used a year or so ago
associating animal slaughterhouses with the holocaust, which is pretty
nasty even to my jaded eyes. So, eat some meat for PETA on the 15th!
Hell, why not start today?
