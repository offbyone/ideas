If you want to while away a few hours, and find out more about one of
the more unnerving
[celebrity-sponsored](http://gawker.com/5002269/the-cruise-indoctrination-video-scientology-tried-to-suppress)
cults out there, I recommend checking out [Operation
Clambake](http://www.xenu.net/) when you have some time to spare.

What I get out of this is a low-level sense of fear that the reportage
we get on the subject of scientology -- or the lack thereof, more
accurately -- is a reflection of a more thorough penetration of the
media by this \_very\_ media-savvy organization.

And then I accuse myself of being paranoid and move on... but never
completely without a care.

Scientology is the one and only thing that makes me \_glad\_ it is
impossible to be elected in the US or Canada without professing to some
christian belief system.

This post brought to you as a tiny, tiny shot from the Internet's side
of [Scientology vs. The
Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology\_vs.\_the\_Internet).
