So we have been in Valdivia now for a day and a half, and today we were told that it is supposed to be the 3rd rainiest place on earth, after the Amazon and somewhere in Scotland.  But that hasn't been the case while we've been here, it has been sunshine all the time (i guess that's their winter, kinda like you poor folks in Vancouver these days).  Valdivia was a very important port in colonial times, as it is at the mouth of one of the only navigable rivers on this coast of South America, and it was the last place to stock up on fresh water before leaving S.America to return to Europe.  So at the mouth of the river the Spanish built 17 forts to protect this valuable resource, effectively barricading the entrance to the rivers.  When Chile gained independence in 1820, this was the last stronghold of the Spaniards, and you would think it would take quite a fleet to defeat the 17 fortifications, but no, the Chileans enlisted the help of an English Captain (Sir Thomas Cochrane), and he beat the Spaniards with 350 men and three ships by landing just out of site and attacking by land in the fog, a move totally unexpected by the entrenched Spaniards.  All in all, a neat bit of history.  So we got to visit a couple of the remaining forts today, as only 4/17 are still standing today, after the strongest earthquake known(9.5 richter scale) hit in 1960 and leveled the rest, along with most of the towns on the coast.

So there's the history lesson.  Since colonial times, steady German immigration to the region has left a heavy stamp on local archetecture and culture, which we've experienced in the locally brewed Kunstmann Bier and various German-style shops and restaurants, notably the Cafè Haussmann, where tonight we sampled their version of steak tartare \*Simon!\*, called Crudos, and had some apple kuchen for dessert.  A neat blend of cultural experiences to have in one day.
