Something I have never looked forward to is knowing that inevitably I will be looking for [advice](http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/14654) on when and how to put down a pet. There\'s definitely a part of me that just hopes that mine won\'t need it, that they\'ll be the freak mutation cats that live as long as I do. Of course the rational side of me knows better.

Still, the link above was full of good advice, advice that I intend to heed when the time comes (which is not now, in case anyone was panicking! All of our cats are as healthy as ever, if completely insane).
