So, i guess i wasn't all that clear - the easy lab yesterday was the Chem 101 last lab - i expect that the lab exam in Chem will be quite a bit harder than the CMPT 114 lab final that i just finished. \<brag\>Damn, was it easy! :) \</brag\>

So, one course down - more or less. Wish that the lecture section of CMPT was a lecture-lab arrangement. Is it just me, or is trying to teach programming without computers kind of foolish?
