So we had a fantastic time last night, we met up with Tullia (Tulia?) and her sister and her brother in law and had some drinks at a cave bar. It was totally awesome! Unfourtunately the couple we had met on the train did not join us, they were a lot of fun, and would have fit right in, I think. I can see why Simon is so fond of her, she is a pretty great gal, and smart and cute. Her sister and brother in law are also a lot of fun, there was much laughing, drinking and toasting going around. Tullia and I even repeatedly toasted the inventer of the vibrator. It was quite funny.

Today I spent shopping pretty much, and am going to go do some more, if I can, it's getting kind of late for that I think, but hey, I"ll try untill I can't try no more! Stuff is reasonably cheap here, so I can come home with lots. (if I have the room)
