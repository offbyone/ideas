Well, Pucon was interesting.  First day, white water rafting in 3-4+ level rapids and getting very wet.  Its neat going over the 5m falls and since I was at the front, looking down at not much but white.

Second day, 1000m+ vertical to the top of an active volcano.  Does it ever stink up there!!!  Actually seen it spit up some magma/lava and should have such as a picture.  That was an extremely tough hike, 1800-2800 in elevation on snow most of the way excèpt the top about 30m but coming down sliding on your back, a body luge type thing for most of the way was neat.  Got soaked bit in the end it was very worth it.  We were well above the surrounding Andes and had a great view from the top.

Third day, Miranda decides I need some exercise so up another 500m+ to Lago Chico, a picturesque lake.  Took some pictures of monkey puzzle trees and stuff.

Pucon itself is very expensive compared to all else down here, almost Canada prices.  But the word is that Argentina is substantially cheaper even than the normal parts of Chile.

We are back almost at the coast, Valdivia.  The drive today was through lush greenery with rolling hills all the way.  There\`s quite a large fish market here, the second we\`ve seen and daily shopping for a seafood based diet, salmon, oysters, mussels, eels, barracudas etc. would be easy and cheap, fresh vegetables in the same market.

Simon, hows the pathfinder?

Soon off to Bariloce, moi
