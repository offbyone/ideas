It looks like there's going to be some serious work starting on one of
my projects, the vcard editor. A few of my classmates and i are planning
on starting work on it over reading week, and if i can get a semi-robust
parser working for it, it's possible that we'll have something that
could pretend to be usable as soon as April.

Of course, the parser thing is a big stumbling block -- it requires
learning things that i've never had to deal with before, so i'm looking
forward to dealing with it as it goes.

Yeah, i know this sort of thing is dull to most of you... But i like it.
