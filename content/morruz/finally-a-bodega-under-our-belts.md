Our last full day in Mendoza, and in fact in Argentina as well, and I finally manage to drag Dad to a bodega. Some small frustrations with buses and directions, but with a little help from friendly locals, we got on the right bus and got off at the right stop. It's so great that there are good people everywhere who are willing to step in and help when it all just seems a little too overwhelming at the time.

So, just one day here, then two days in Valpariso (dad and I both decided we'd rather spend our last days there than in Santiago) and then the long flight home. I can't stress too much how great an investment my Spanish course was. I'm so much more able to hear and understand the little parts of the language, able to put full scentences together, learning new words all the time, it just works. And for reading, it's even easier. Last night at for the barbeque (read Dad's post below) I was able to have a conversation with Isabel about cultural differences, politics and environment, among other things. Though, to look at it another way, Dad was up on the roof with Walter the whole evening, neither of them able to speak to each other, but they managed to communicate plenty. They seem to have common interests: drinking wine and watching women. Lots of hand-waving and "Cheers!" later, they were great pals. p.s. Walter and Isabel are the couple whose house we are staying in, not really a hostel, more that they rent out rooms in their house.

Anyways, looking forwards to seeing some of you soon.
