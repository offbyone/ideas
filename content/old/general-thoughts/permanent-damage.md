# Permanent Damage

I got a phone call from my physician on Wednesday in which he told me
that the MRI I had indicated cartilage damage in the shoulder, and that
I was going to be at risk of join instability pretty much forever.

Which does *not* bode well for my ability to jump.

I'm going to try, anyway. The first few jumps will be scary, because I
don't know if I'll be able to land it, let alone drive home, so I'll
make sure to have someone there with me, but I believe that the position
in which I'd be at risk is one that I can avoid by careful flying.
