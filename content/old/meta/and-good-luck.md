Good morning.

As some of you may recall, once upon a time I started a blog called "schoolblog" based on my progression through the educational system. It was a tiny little side project, and really, it stayed that way all along. Now, or more specifically, yesterday, that process came to its conclusion at the U of A convocation ceremonies.

So, I'm done.

And, as has been increasingly obvious, so is this blog, at least as it currently exists. I don't seem to have the impulse to write, and if the comment rate is any indication, what little I do write is not spurring conversations either. Given these two strikes, I cannot see myself having anything to say for a while.

I'm not getting rid of the domain, so it might come back at some future date, but in the meantime...

Good night.
