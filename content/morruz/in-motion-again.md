We moved from Conception to Pucon today.  Interesting drive.  Basically, Chile has a climb in elevation from the ocean up to the main plateau.  By Valparaiso it was quite mountainous but by Concepcion not so noticeable.  The whole area we have travelled has been green, absolutely no desert yet not rainforest anywhere.  Today, up into some thick greenery and then south.  The farming is now grain, oats and wheat, not orchards although there are some of them too, apples and such, not grapes nor anymore corn fields.  From Temura to Pucon, we were still on the plateau but going straight at the mountains, especially, the active volcano.

Pucon, imagine a beautiful blue mountain lake at the foot of the mountains surrouneded by lush greenery, a snow covered cone with a smoking problem at your back.  Yes, snow covered, that´s how high it rises above this low elevation plateau.  Likely we will be climbing it shortly.  This is quite a town for Chile, uptown galore.

Just so you know it is not all fun and stuff down here, yours truly is recovering from sunburn on the top of my left foot, some sympathy would be appreciated.
