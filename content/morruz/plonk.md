As in, we have landed.

As anyone who has traveled knows, there's something particularly jarring about the plastic world that envelops you from the moment you enter your airport of origin to, in my case, the first morning that I \_wake up\_ in my eventual destination. I'm just coming out of that envelope, sadly without recourse to caffeine, unless I get up the energy to go coffee-vending-machine hunting... which I might just do.

Oh, and it turns out that, amusingly, neither Char nor I has a clue how to operate an ATM :)

### Update, Later that day

Well, I got off my ass and went for a stroll while I waited for Char & Jamie to return from their luggage-returning odyssey. Sadly, the ramen place that Jamie recommended was not open, but I did manage to redeem myself somewhat by A) spotting a post office and B) successfully operating its ATM.

Now, I'm sitting here, tinkering with the Morruz blog tools (see the shiny new map?) and sipping Japanese beer, waiting for my lovely traveling (and life) companion to return from Narita airport, hopefully with some clothes to call her own :)
