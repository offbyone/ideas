Well, since my foolishness caused our laptop keyboard to acheive b0rkedness (spill dole juice on your keyboard. Observe follies) I've been immobile.

Til now.

A guy in \[UACS\](<http://www.uacs.ca>) was kind enough to loan me a roll-up keyboard. I shit you not, this thing looks like it could take immersion in _acid_. The tactile element is a bit out, but I'm getting used to it \-- it's a bit springy, and takes a bit of force to press keys, but other than that it works a lot better than the one that doesn't work that is attached to the laptop.

It's slated for replacement, though.

This will be weird.
