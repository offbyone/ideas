I popped down to the internet cafe in Paris whilst Char sleeps in a bit to do this last bit of postery. We're heading off to the airport in two hours, starting the last, longest, and least pleasant leg of the vacation -- the ten-hour flight and 3.5-hour drive home.

We'll see you all over the next little while, probably in small doses because we're gonna be wiped right out :)
