\[Aaron\](<http://www.spaz.ca>) mentioned \[TED\](<http://www.ted.com/>) to me some time ago as an interesting place to go for talks about the world; technology, science, economics, politics.

I finally got around to checking it out, and I have to admit, there's a lot there.

It's a time-consumer, no question, with the video talks running to 20 minutes each, so you might not get to see all of it at a shot, but I'm convinced it's worthwhile. Right now I'm watching a talk on the application of economics to explaining AIDS in Africa, and there's more like that.

Check it out.
