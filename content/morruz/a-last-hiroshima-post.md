So, our travels have not been so exotic, of course, having visited a country that has a subtropical climate, but we've had some interesting times nonetheless.

So, wednesday Char and I attached gathered up some fellow travelers; a pair of scots (Craig and Allison) and a pair of kiwis (Diana and John) and headed off to Miyajima, which is an island temple at the base of Mt. Misen, atop which is a second (third? There's a mess of temples around here...) temple. There's *ordinarily* a gondola (called a ropeway, here) up to the 2/3 mark of the mountain route, but of course it was down until Feb 28.

So, we walked.

529m above sea level, the view is pretty incredible. Look for Char's pictures, later. The walk down was jelly-legged, but satisfying.

We finished the day with Okonomiyaki, which is the Hiroshima specialty; it's a sort of scrambled egg/noodle/bacon/cabbage/crepe/shrimp/squid thingy, all made into a pizza-ish deal and fried up; very tasty.

Yesterday, John and Diana joined us at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, which is a long, on-message, and tasteful condemnation of nuclear weapons. I was interviewed for NHK, which I understand is something like the BBC, but Japanese. I wonder if that will end up being aired? I bet not, but I'll also never know.

Then, in the evening, loud, beer-fueled Uno with british travelers.

Today, we are off to Tokyo, for two more days with Jamie and then home, but it's been pretty interesting.
