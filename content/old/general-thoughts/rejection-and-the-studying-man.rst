Just finished my last shift at $(COMPANY) yesterday, and i've taken away
some valuable lessons about work in the lower echelons of the big
companies. It seems, for reasons i don't fully understand, that
$(COMPANY) is not really interested in investing in its future
employees. Now, in the non-technical end of the organization, where i
was employed, that doesn't surprise me. I can not fault them for
short-sightedness, given the rapid turnover of their current employees -
when someone's only there for a year, don't waste the investment effort.

Where i can fault them, though, is in the short-sightedness of the
internet unit. While the helpdesk is not a technical job in any real
way, it is related. And despite this, they focus their hiring
exclusively on non-students. Once again, i've been rejected for
employment specifically because i am trying to better myself. It's
frustrating to me. $(COMPANY) is a big part of the technology field in
Alberta, and i'd like to keep it in mind for my future employment. But i
get the powerful feeling that i'm not going to even look at it when i
job hunt, because i know all too well that their priorities do not match
mine. I value education, and $(COMPANY) does not.

In an industry that moves this fast, wouldn't it seem to be the case
that getting hold of the workers of the future is a wise investment?
Wish somebody would tell `$(COMPANY) <http://www.telus.com/>`__ that.
