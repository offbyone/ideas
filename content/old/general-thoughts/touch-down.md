Aternately:  A touch down.

Not really, I guess, but it\'s interesting decompressing and realizing how much stuff I need to get done.  I freely admit, I\'m procrastinating something fierce right now, trying to avoid actually workingon anything productive.  Bah.  How \... normal.

Anyway, EclipseCon was great.  I hope I\'ll be able to make it again next year, although I doubt it, since next year I\'ll be schooling full-time, and I don\'t expect I\'ll be in the same position to ask for favours from work.  Still, one never knows.
