Further news in that whole cloning issue:

It seems that the current state of affairs - that of Clonaid refusing to identify the parents of the supposedly cloned child - may actually be based not upon a desire to dodge proving the truth of their claims, but may instead be related to the state of Florida's stated intent to [take the child away from her parents](http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/South/01/11/clonaid.court.ap/index.html). Who knew?

I don't think anyone's gonna be surprised when I hold forth saying that this is an appalling invasion of personal rights. As some Mefi [discussion](http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/22794) on the subject suggests, this sort of behaviour offends even some anti-cloning sorts.

Now, of course, there's still no proof that the cloning even occurred\... I guess we'll find out someday, hm?
