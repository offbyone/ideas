For an actually _balanced_ view of the Fahrenheit 9/11 hype and bull, I recommend that you see [this review](http://www.theonionavclub.com/cinema/index.php?issue=4026#review7) at The Onion. I'm shocked, actually. The Onion's leanings are virulently anti-Bush most of the time, and this one is still clearly toned that way, but the review itself is way more balanced than I expected.

Other reviews can be found "here":http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Fahrenheit911-1133649/ as well, where they are nearly uniformly good.

I'm starting to think that I should see this film, but I really don't want to give Moore any of my money. Decisions, decisions\...
