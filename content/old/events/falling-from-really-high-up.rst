Further news on the skydiving scenario:

I have received the coupons promised me from `Eden
North <http://www.edennorth.com/>`__, and far from the trivial $10-ish
off that I was expecting (from a base price of $185 per jumper) the
coupons are for 20% off, dropping the price of a first jump to $148
each. Which is significantly more reasonable, and I hope that this will
persuade a few people who are waffling that this is a \_really good
idea\_ (tm)
