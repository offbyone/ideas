So, Char and I are -- by virtue of the conditions of our current residence -- about to embark on a second\... _adventure_. We're buying a house. Together. Like real adults, with real responsibilities. This falls firmly into the scary end of the spectrum.

I wrote the first part of this post with something firmly in mind, but for the life of me I can't recall what that was. It's worth noting, though, that blogging on an iPhone is not as effective as on a computer. It's slower, by far, for one, and it's a pain in the ass to do _italics_ or **bold** text.

Anyway, house shopping.

Char and I are looking at some places tonight, some of which are just freaking gorgeous. We've got some nice neighborhoods picked out, and in general I'm pretty happy with the state of the housing market in Edmonton right now, which I suppose indicates that I've got radically lowered standards than I used to have. It's grotesque, the prices I now consider to be 'good' prices for a house.

I hope that we'll have more good news on this sort of subject soon, because we'd both like to get as little stress as we can out of this.

I'll try to be more consistent, by the way; I've gotten right out of the habit of blogging ([like some I could mention](http://www.offby1.net/mildillson/)) and as a consequence I need to whip myself into posting. Rest assured, I've got a lot on my mind.

\## Update

Wow. What a pain in the ass.

So, I wrote this a week ago, and hit 'publish'\... or thought I did. Nope.

So, in the meantime, we bought a house. Nothing major, there ;)
