Ours is but to question [why](http://www.newscientist.com/channel/space/mg18524911.600).

A list of things that aren't really well-explained, at least by reputable, peer-reviewed science. I'll leave aside the issue of crackpot theorists whose entire contribution to the scientific method is to serve as an example to others.

Good read, here. Especially interesting (to me) since the announcement of the artificial creation of a [black hole](<http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/17/1541230&tid=14>). If you're more interested in this than I am, you may want to check out the actual [results](<http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0501068> from the experiement) ([Simon](<http://vernondalhart.livejournal.com>)?) and draw some of your own conclusions.
