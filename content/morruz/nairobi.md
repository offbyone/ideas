Well, I am here. First thing I noticed on the ground is that they drive on the wrong side of the road, not bad when you are in a taxi but I'm still not used to which way to watch for cars while crossing the street. By the way, I am now a professional j-walker.  
Nairobi itself is quite a nice city, lots of green. The biggest thing I've noticed is that there is minimal garbage downtown, one of the cleanest cities I've visited. It is really helped by the fact that there is a major fine if you smoke on the sidewalk, they have designated areas only for my evil habit. Even so, they don't litter like most places I've visited. But, note, I've only seen downtown.  
Tonight I get together with my next group and we leave tomorrow. Boy is the sun wicked hot here in the afternoon. Supposedly, right when we get back is the start of the rainy season. Interesting how the working women hit on you.
