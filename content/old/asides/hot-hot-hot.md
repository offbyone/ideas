But, of course, you know that.

What you don't know is that\... um\...

Let's see. In the spirit of the \[Facebook\](<http://www.facebook.com/>) thingy, how about a few things you don't know about me?

| 1. I have a soft spot for sappy romantic movies (_not_ comedies).
| 2. For all that I'm a private person, I love it when people randomly visit.
| 3. I cannot make myself play evil characters in computer games, no matter how hard I try.
| 4. I am pessimistic about the future of our species.
| 5. Adventure? Excitement? Oh, _yes_, I crave these things!
