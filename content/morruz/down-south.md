OK, we are in Punta Arenas, there is almost no land of the continental americas south of us and we have our boat trip to Peurto Williams booked, maybe the southernmost part of the trip. It´s cool down here, 12-15 C and right on the straits of Magellan. No stories for you all today. People are very friendly and helpful here, neat hospedaje here.
