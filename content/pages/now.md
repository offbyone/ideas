I'm living in <a href="/tag/seattle.html">Seattle</a>, having been here since 2011 when I moved here for <a href="/category/amazon.html">a job with AWS</a>.

My work these days is with [GitHub](https://github.com), where I'm working on some of our enterprise product ... "stuff".

I live full time with my partner and part time with my high school age son, who splits time between here and his other parent's place in Oregon.

I work on open source when I can find the time, mostly Python stuff, or just chipping in small changes where something catches my eye.

If you read SF/F, you may have heard of [the Hugo Awards](https://www.thehugoawards.org/). I'm the developer of [NomNom](https://nomnom.fans), which is the software that collects nominations, votes, and links to the Hugo finalist packet. 

I have a homelab and an old house, both of which give me infinte opportunities to tinker. If I run out of ideas there, I'm also the admin of [wandering.shop](https://wandering.shop/).
