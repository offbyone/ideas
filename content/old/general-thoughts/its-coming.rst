Amazon.ca just sent me word that there's a little
`something <http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000069F5H/qid=1036906199/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_19_1/702-3144863-0812038>`__
has been shipped at long last. Gawd DAMN, i'm looking forward to this
one... It'll be here late next week, and i swear, i'm just about
drooling :)
