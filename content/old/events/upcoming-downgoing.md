So, I dropped off the deposits for the three people who have confirmed that they're coming jumping with me next weekend: \[Matt\](<http://www.offlineblog.com/mildillson/>), \[Amy\](<http://lashingtail.blogspot.com/>), and Beau. Anyone else interested should get hold of me ASAP so that I can confirm it with the drop zone. I know that there are a lot of you out there that I'd love to see out there, but if I don't hear from you I guess I'll just have to guilt trip you later :)

I'm looking forward to this with intense anticipation. And there may be another surprise there too, but I don't want to get too excited about that, since it'd be a big one.

Also note that I fixed a small bug in the Mars-Spirit theme for the site. It should look a LOT better in comments now.
