act, the complete works of (the _non-evil_) Sir Willy Shakespeare can be... energetic. Three Fools Company put on an amusing show consisting of 37 plays... in 97 minutes. Given that Hamlet on its own took 40 of those, that's no mean feat. They did take advantage of the similarities between the bard's comedies to mash 16 of them into three minutes of simulcast babblery, but I'd say that Titus Andronicus as a cooking show takes the cake. Figuratively speaking, of course.

Good times were had.
