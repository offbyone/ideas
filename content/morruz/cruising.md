Sorry about the long gap between posts, internet on the ship is crazy expensive, .75 USD per minute!  
It is a huge and beautiful ship, population altogether about the equivalent of half of Peace River. I have to say, I would not do it this way next time. We went on one organized excursion yesterday because it was the only way we would have time to get to where we wanted to go, but it was too crowded, too many people at once. Michael, you would definitely understand. From here on we will just go on our own when we stop.  
Right now I am sitting in an internet cafe on the harbour in Mykonos, with a cold Mythos beer watching the sun shine off the water. This is very much a tourist Mecca, full of tiny expensive shops and "beautiful people". I can't spend any money, though, because I already blew the budget completely in Turkey. I bought not 1 but 2 gorgeous rugs! You'll see when I get home, I can't seem to get pictures on here. The last night in Istanbul I thought I uploaded some photos but now I can't find them, so that will have to wait.  
Our stateroom is really comfortable, nice view just above the waterline. Food is fantastic, great variety. It's too bad booze is extra, we've managed to smuggle a few beer aboard but otherwise it's \$10 for a glass of wine or a drink. So far Harvey hasn't put the tie on the door, so no free drinks for me yet :)  
Entertainment has been fun, shows every evening and it's fun to watch people in the casino. I've budgeted \$10 a day for gambling, and yesterday I actually came up \$15 ahead - so Jeannie, I owe you money. I'm not very adventurous, so odds of a big win are slim. You never know, though - I might hit the big one yet.  
Yesterday we went to the place where the Virgin Mary was supposed to have lived out her old age. I lit a candle for Grandma, and got her some water from the spring. Very touristy but surprisingly affecting. We then went to the ruins of Ephesus. What a place! It gives you an idea of what man could do to the environment even then, the place used to be a harbour but now is miles from the sea because they cut down all the trees and the harbour silted up. Good farming, though, the soil is good even though it doesn't rain much.  
Gotta go, my time is up. I'll try again from Santorini tomorrow if I can drag myself from the beach :)
