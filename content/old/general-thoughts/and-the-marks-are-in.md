Final grade back across the board:

* CMPT 201: A
* CMPT 229: A
* MATH 125: A
* STAT 221: B
* PSYC 104: B+

The last one is the most depressing of the lot - if i did a B+, why were there people struggling in that course? This is fscking _university_, for pete's sake. What place do *multiple choice exams* have at this level?

Damn.

At any rate, there they are. My overall GPA for the semester was 3.660, and my cumulative GPA at Grant Macewan is 3.592. Not too shabby, if i do say so myself.
