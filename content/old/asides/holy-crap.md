I forgot I even had this site.

Heh

Char\'s been at me again, so here\'s the updated skinny: We\'re swimming, which is good. That\'s really about it.

I\'ve got some nifty projects on my plate at work, which is great. On the home-project front, [Aaron](http://www.spaz.ca/) got it into his head to rewrite CRON-O-Meter from the ground up, which means, well, I get a break :)

Heh

Nothing new in the world, folks. Politics as usual, business the same.

How are all of you?
