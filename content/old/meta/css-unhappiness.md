I'm informed - and have at last noticed, myself, that my site is looking, um, like shit in IE. Weird. Ah...

I apologize for the poor appearance, and will get cracking on it as soon as i have time, but until then, well i recommend using a [real browser](http://www.mozilla.org/) to view it anyway. :)

Yes, i'm a geek. But it really is a nicer browser. Now... what the hell is wrong here...

(/me wanders off grumbling...)

**Update:**
I've found and fixed the bug - it was a small glitch with comment tags, and now it is gone. All should be well from here on out. Readers care to comment on the current appearance?
