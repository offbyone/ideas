With a flutter or two of butterflies in my stomach to keep me company on
the way up, it is *done*! I am now certified to jump solo at the club
level, meaning only at [Eden North](http://www.edennorth.com/), and I'm
a short hop away from being able to solo it anywhere at all.

I also flew through a cloud once I was under canopy. Which was pretty
cool.
