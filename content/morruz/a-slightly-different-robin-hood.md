So last night Šár and I decided to catch some local theatre... the lady at the hotel told us that there would be a play about some local hero that we would likely never have heard of... Janišek. The guy from Terchová. So of couse we went! Who cares if we wouldn't understand, it's not like we knew what the hell was going on in any of the Operas, let alone the English one.

Lucky us, it turned out to be a Rock musical, so even though the dialog was incomprehensible, the music was really good. But it gets even better. Šár noticed sooner than I did, but the actor who played Janišek was... the singer from the band Arzén. Seriously. So we got to see him two days in a row! The musical was great (and I sort of understood the second half), and so today I ended up buying a best-of CD from Arzén. Tragically, they were out of CDs from the actual play. However, when I get back to Canada, I'm totally going to track down a copy to order online.
