It's been, and will be, an interesting couple of weeks. I'm creating some genuinely nifty things at work these days, and I'm going to be assembling interesting code for school.

The former has been an introduction to the general concepts of LDAP; I've had to get at least a bit familiar with it in order to put together a critical piece of functionality for our client. The latter, well, I took the hard part of the project, as is my wont, and it's been nifty, getting it all working.

So, there's that.

Plus papers..

Plus presentations\...

Plus finals, upcoming\...

Mind you, none of this is on the scale of Simon's workload. Congrats on the thesis presentation!
