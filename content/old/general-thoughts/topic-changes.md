Well, short-term at least, this blog has talked more about hockey than anything.

Not to say I've been verbose, or anything like that.

But what a game, again.

On schooly notes, I've got a final exam tomorrow that I expect to do\... poorly at. If I had known that Philosophy courses deliberately eschewed clear english in favour of meaningless jumbles of ten-dollar words, I'd have passed on the course. Now, I'll be happy to simply *pass* the course.

Bah.
