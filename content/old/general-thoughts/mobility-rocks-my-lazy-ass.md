I gots a laptop! ;)

Okay, colour me fourteen shades of enthused about this. It's not quite the godbox i drool over, but it's mobile, it's powerful, it's colourful, and it's ours! :)

If i needed another sign that Char's the gal for me, the fact that she was as enthusiastic about this as i am was more than enough confirmation for me... Can't go wrong - geek chick and cute, to boot!
