One thing I forgot to mention yesterday was, walking from the bus station, Morris was saying about whether the hostal owner would be around. I looked up the street and said, isn´t that her walking towards us? Sure enuff. Great friendly welcome as she also recognized us.  
Last night there was a issue as a backpack was gone from the building for a NZer who was catching a flight out at 10:00. Needless to say there was some loud words.  
Great little cervesa break down at the port, had me an admirerer that I admired myself. Found most of the spots we remember. Playing cards, had a young family paying us alot of attention, Morris visited easlily with the mom and children-
