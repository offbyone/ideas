Well, not just yet, but I'm flying out this weekend, and I just wrapped up what (I hope) should be the last of the work I had to crunch to get done this week.

I was at work a good, long time yesterday, 's for sure.

So, Char and I are going to spend some time this weekend hanging out together, and some time hanging out with friends, and then we're parting for the week. Bummer. Still, sunny California \... ;)

Anyway, this is a "before-going" update. Look forward to an "I'm there" update as well :)
