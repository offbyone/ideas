Yesterday, on the way home from \_Lobster Telephone\_, a play starring
Mark Meer as Salvador Dali (+ others), A lady on the bus spoke to me,
pointing out the beautiful colours of the sunset happening outside the
bus window behind me.

It's a rare thing, that people speak to strangers in public. It caught
me off guard, but I made an effort to be responsive, in order to leave
her feeling as though she should do it again. That, and it really
\_was\_ a very pretty sunset.
