Well, not so much. But I really do have nothing to say.

A quick sum-up:

| Work: Active, rewarding, and busy.
| Friends: Hanging out with a bit more, which is good.
| School: Really iffy on Philosophy 250 \-- this is some wonky stuff, if you ask me.

The world: Fucked, man. Hypocrisy in Congress down south, media shutdown up here\...

I\'d rather not think about it.
