That went remarkably well, i think. I had an interview this morning with ATS out at the International Airport, and basically got told that i can A) have my cake and B) eat it too. The upshot of the interview this morning was that i would train with ATS early next week, starting monday. Then, on the 16th i would start with Telus, informing ATS of my schedule from Telus. Then, lastly, when the employment with Telus is up, i'd start working part time at the airport. Best of both worlds! I now have a permanent part-time job, and a temporary, seasonal one that pays better for December.

W00t! :)

So, feel free to pat me on the back, tell me i kick ass, all that other good stuff. You know i deserve it :)
