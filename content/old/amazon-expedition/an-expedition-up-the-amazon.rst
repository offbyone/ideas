About three months ago, I was contacted by a recruiter for Amazon. Yes,
that Amazon. The big kahuna. One of the titans of the tech industry.
Some emails flew back and forth, some phone interviews occurred, and one
in-person interview as well, and shortly after PyCon US 2011 (which was
awesome, by the way!) I was made an offer that I couldn't refuse.

So, here I am. In Seattle, a resident of the USA, joined by Char &
Matthew in what could be at least described as the most disruptive job
change I've ever had.

I've been on the ground here for three weeks, now; today was work day 22
as an Amazonian. In that time, I've come to realize how little I know
about certain aspects of the profession I've chosen; the kinds of
technical decisions that drive what I do now are so far beyond what I'd
done in the past as to feel like a different job. At the same time, I'm
coping with leaving behind all of the friends I've painstakingly met and
grown to love. It's a challenge.

It's a good thing, I think, and once the major problems that face us due
to the move -- selling our house without losing our shirts, finding a
nice place to live here -- get out of the way, I think we'll have no
trouble finding new friends and common interests. That said, it's not
going to be the same. I may, if I'm truly, truly fortunate, find friends
that will come to be as important as those I've left behind, but I will
never replace them.

I'm hoping that, like the period I spent in school (that spurred the
creation of this mode of expression in the first place) I will write
more often in this space. I suspect that I've got no readers left, but
I'll be trying to remedy that the old-fashioned way. Please, comment
often; knowing that people read these -- and having a conversation with
them -- will force me to keep writing. And to keep in touch. I need both
of these things.
