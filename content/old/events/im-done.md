Sweet zombie Jebus, I'm _done_!

Oh, the bliss of having _weekends_ again; of being able to read guilt-free. Of playing games, of having days that end at 5 pm _some_ of the time, even if not all of the time.

Oh, and the \~\$20,000/year raise (as of monday) doesn't hurt. Did I mention they hired me?
