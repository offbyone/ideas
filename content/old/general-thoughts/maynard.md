Nothing on internet censorship (note: If you're on a Canadian ISP and reading this, there are now sites blocked for all Canadians. Right now they're kiddie porn only\... but it's a short step from that to deciding other sites are _objectionable_ and blockable. Your ISP \-- the one you _pay to provide you with internet access_ \-- is doing this. Respond as you will).

What I'm actually posting on is an excellent [interview with Maynard James Keenan](http://www.avclub.com/content/node/55757) (of Tool) at the Onion AV Club.

The quote that really got me is this one:

| \>All I can do is say I smell a rat. I don't know where it is or what kind of rat it is, but as an artist,
| \>I can express how [I feel about it]. But I couldn't responsibly stand up and tell people which way to go,
| \>because then I'm just as guilty as the people who are telling everybody else what to do and where to
| \>go.

He's quite a guy, one with whom I've no doubt that I could argue for days.
