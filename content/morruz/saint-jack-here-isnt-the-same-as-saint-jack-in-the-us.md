We just sent back our bikes from our daytrip out to one of the more remote beaches. Nice drive, nice beach, and a restaurant on it to boot. I had a salad of in season fruits and veg that was dressed with shrimp mousse and "garnished" with Gambas, or Scampi. (the scampi were bigger than the glass, let alone any of the individual parts of the salad) Then, there was tanning, reading, lazing and more biking. Nice picnic if you ask me.

I think one of the major differences to me (Chris has a different perspective) between this place and other resort towns I've been to, is that the beaches have all these restaurants on them, and you can use their beach chairs, or just drink on the beach and not have to be staying at that hotel, or whatever. I kind of like it. Going off in the middle of nowhere, finding a beach, and low and behold, there is a bar there! and it serves haute cuisine!
