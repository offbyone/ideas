\### Update

Interestingly, today Bruce Schneier wrote an article about culture\'s \[war on the unexpected\]([http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/the\\\_war\\\_on\\\_the.html](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/the\_war\_on\_the.html)) that fits really nicely with this. It illustrates the flat-out falsehood of the statement \"\_If you\'ve done nothing wrong, you\'ve got nothing to fear.\_\"

I have a hard time reading this; I realize that it\'s unlikely that any of this will happen to me, but that\'s not because it \_can\'t\_, it\'s because on some level I\'m already suppressed in that way. This stuff makes me sick inside.
