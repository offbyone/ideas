Well, given that there were only two interviews for [IIP](http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/iip) positions located in Edmonton, at least as far as those in Edmonton, I'm pleased to say that I was either number 1 and number 2 in the rankings for the positions.

The one for which I was #1 was here on campus, and it was interesting, but not as interesting as the one I will be taking with ACI Worldwide, starting in May. I hope that I'll be able to handle the work, but in the end I'm pretty sure I can.

So, that's set. All worries aside, I do have my job set for the 16 months following my third year.
