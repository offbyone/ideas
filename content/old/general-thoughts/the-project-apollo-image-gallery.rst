NASA has just updated `the Project Apollo Image
Gallery <http://www.apolloarchive.com/apollo_gallery.html>`__ with
photos from the Apollo 11 mission.

Although at present the site is still
[slashdotted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdotted) into submission,
preventing me from actually viewing the images, I wanted to make sure
that you all saw them.

A return soon, I hope.
