Hej,

As you see from Dad´s post below, we have arrived in Chile and are once again in Valpo. Nothing really new to write yet, as we haven´t really done anything yet. All I can say is it´s a nice feeling to be comfortable and relaxed here, not stressing over things cause it´s all so familiar and we've been here before and know the drill. Same with all the necessary airport travel, we've become fairly accustomed to it and it's less stressful every time.

So some not so good news is that I looked up the ferry schedules for the ferry from Puerto Montt to Punta Natales and one of their two boats is down for the next month with mechanical difficulties, resulting in the cancellation of half of the sailings, so it only leaves from either end of the route every two weeks. So that makes it tough for timing and also with that many cancellations and reschedulings it's possible that there won't even be any available seats. Hmmm. Already having to rethink some things. Oh well, that's the way we like to do things.

More on this later,  
love Mir
