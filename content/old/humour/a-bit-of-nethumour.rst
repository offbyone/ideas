Found on the interweb a short time ago, and brought again to my
attention today by the good folks at MetaFilter:

`Events since Duke Nukem Forever was
announced <http://duke.a-13.net/>`__.

This is a bit of a sobering list of things that have happened since DNF
was announced nine+ years ago. The truly jarring one is the fact that
NASA -- amongst the most legendarily ponderous bureaucracies in North
America -- "proposed, authorized, announced, designed, launched and
successfully landed [the two Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity] upon
Mars where they have been exploring the surface for over 2.5 years."

Wow.
