Getting the last few courses out of the way is, strangely, shaping up to be somewhat unsatisfying. I can't seem to shake the desire to phone in the last year of my education, skipping the hard parts and concentrating on just getting the official documentation of my education.

This isn't, obviously, a constructive sentiment.

Still, it's nice to be in the visible homestretch. I have eight months of part time coming up, four months of the real world in the summer again, and then one last, lazy semester to nail down the last of my requirements, and then, in January 2008, at the age of 30, I'll get to graduate.

2008\.

Damn me.
