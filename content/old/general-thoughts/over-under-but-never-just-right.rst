Here's something interesting... Bruce Schneier writing about [people's
overreactions to
risk](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/05/rare\_risk\_and\_o.html),
a topic near and dear to my heart.

Security theatre is no new thing to any of us; we all see instances of
it in the invasive checks while boarding planes (shoe bombs? Did anyone
actually think that'd work?) and the preemtive measures taken to prevent
hollywood threats that are neither plausible, nor likely (I'm thinking
laptop bombs, et al).

It's not like I have anything approaching a solution here, of course --
it's just bloody frustrating that this keeps happening.
