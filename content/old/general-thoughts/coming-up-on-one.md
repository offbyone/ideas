The end of my first semester is fast approaching, and i have to say, i couldn't be happier. And by that i don't mean happy that the semester is ending, but rather happy that the new semester is coming. I sat down and added it up today, and the jump in workload between this semester and the last one will be astronomical. I'm looking at the following:
5 full-time courses (ENGL-101, MATH-115, CMPT-115, CMPT-272, and CHEM-102)
4 Labs - in every course except English
and lastly, one seminar in CMPT-272.

This is gonna be fun :)
