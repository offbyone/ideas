Well, we're in El Chalten, about to catch the bus to Calafate then fly to Buenos tonight. This town is right on the edge of the Andes with glaciars around and is known for some really good trekking. Sweet place. I can't believe that so far there has been no rock climbing on the faces behind the town. When we came down from yesterdays hike we spotted a restaurant with 'Hoy, curantos' so supper was chosen. We got to see the preparation and all. This looks easy to do. Really enjoyed the meal, they basically kept putting meat on your plate until you said stop.  
Well, starting tonight, finally warm weather, I just can't see it being any better than what we've been doing, just additionally interesting.
