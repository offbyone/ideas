Found on Salon.com (you have to view a short ad to check it out, but it\'s worth it) is a [confession of a semi-successful author](http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2004/03/22/midlist/). Pretty interesting read, and definitely a hint that maybe some things don\'t carry over well to the system of economics i prefer.

I\'m just sayin\'
