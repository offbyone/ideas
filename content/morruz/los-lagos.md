This portion of south america, Patagonia, is really something else.  Gorgeous lakes with mountain backdrops.  The forests vary but lots of huge trees.  At the pass between Chile and Argentina we were almost at tree line.  Both leaving Chile and entering Argentina, about an hour apart by bus, we had to wait around for about an hour to get checked through but no difficulties at all.  Meeting neat people, in fact today in Bariloce Miranda was recognized on the street by a couple we met in Pucon, Nicholas and Carolinas, so a short visit happened with them and friends.

Steak last night at Albertos was very good, Mirandas was even rare enough.  Tasty meat.  We plan on trying jabali, wild boar, while here and maybe wild deer or fondue.  Chocolate shops everywhere, supermarkets in some cases.  If anyone would like a real nice place to come camp, hike, stay in cabanas, see mountains and lakes, this is definetely one of the prettiest places I´ve seen.

Miranda forced me this morning to walk all the way to a bakery to get her fresh bread for breakfast and then slept in until it was cold, I enjoyed it fresh though.

I do like the people, the scenery and will always recommend people add this to their travel lists, moi
