It\'s a pretty nice evening here. I\'m sitting on the couch in the living room, Char just beside me reading her Dark Tower book and Ivan on my lap.

I don\'t have to get up in the morning, and I have plans to get some quality geeking in when I do.

The weather is windy and cloudy, threatening rain.

I saw the Bourne Supremacy tonight, and other than a strong desire to throttle the cinematographer, it was excellent, tense and fast and exciting.

The book that I\'m reading\... Okay, \_one\_ of the books that I\'m reading is about Faerie and it\'s really nifty. Anyone that likes fantasy should really read Tad Williams\' \_The War of the Flowers\_ at their soonest convenience.

Amongst the other books that I\'m reading is Neal Stephenson\'s \_The Diamond Age\_, which looks to be an interesting take on the cyberpunk idiom, and Bruce Schneier\'s \_Applied Cryptography\_ \-- required reading for any cryptonuts in the crowd.

Right now, I am relaxed. And life is good.
