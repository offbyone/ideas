I've just finished reading a whole whackpile of Buffy comics. Both the
regular series, which essentially fills in gaps in the `main
chronology <http://www.upn.com/shows/buffy/backstory/index.shtml>`__,
and the `Fray <http://www.buffycollector.com/comics/fray.shtml>`__
miniseries set some 200+ years in the future. The combined experiences
leave me wondering something.

Why is it that, in every comic book future, the future is portrayed as a
grim, dystopian place? I'm sitting here absorbing the reads and
wondering, what's the point of all this gloom? I can think of a few
possible reasons, and I think i want to go over them here.

First, there's the obvious one. For some reason or other, nearly every
single comic writer who has ever felt like doing a future story has
concluded, after giving it a lot of thought, that the future is doomed
to be this tangle of gloom, petty crime, technological dehumanization,
and mutations. In addition, of course, the societies of that era will be
stratified to an extreme, with the lower castes being the sole
repository of goodness, and the forces of law something to be respected
at most and feared most of the time.

Second is the almost-as-obvious suggestion that, just maybe, these
people need to take the `Blade
Runner <http://directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Movies/Titles/B/Blade_Runner/?tc=1>`__
DVD out of the player, put the
`Gibson <http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/>`__ and
`Sterling <http://www.chriswaltrip.com/sterling/>`__ in a box to gather
dust, and spend a little bit of their creative energies imagining their
*own* visions of the future. But, hey, that's just a suggestion.

Thirdly is a possiblity that just occurred to me a few minutes ago, and
that's that the writers have to use futures of such crushing darkness to
contrast the light that they want us to see in their heroes. We've
gotten so accustomed to the old hero cliches that there's really not
much an average writer can give us to make us sit up and go "Wow, what a
hero!" So, instead, they feed us middle-grade heroes who are made to
seem special more by the collection of superpowers and the dearth of
hope that they have, instead of by being a character that overcomes the
more mundane. Now, i can see a lot of fiction that this accusation could
apply to, and I suspect that very little of it fits. But it's a thought.

I guess it's just me, sitting here feeling a bit doomy about the future.
It's corny, but I really do need to believe that there's more than that.
The things i want to see don't happen in worlds like that. I want to see
growth, light, strength, not this pathetic caricature of a future, where
technology has become dead weight, not the wings it should be.
