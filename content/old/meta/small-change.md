I've made a tiny change to the site with regards to those damned random things over to your right \-- assuming, of course, you're seeing this on the index page. Basically, i set it up through unix "voodoo":http://www.google.com/search?num=50&hl=en&lr=lang_en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=define%3Acron&btnG=Search to rebuild the front page every hour, thus making the random things cycle. Basically, that means that ever hour or so there'll be a nifty new link and quote to check out.

Hope that means that they'll be getting more attention. Or not, if they suck. But really, I don't care about that :)
