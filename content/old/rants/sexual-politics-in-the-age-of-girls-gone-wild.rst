There's an "article (What part of no do ya still not
understand?)":http://www.laweekly.com/ink/03/53/features-lewis.php on
the LA Weekly site taking about the current thoughts - from a wide
social perspective - on the date rape issue.

It makes a few fairly strong points, and is nearly unique in the
articles i've read in that it actually goes so far as to suggest that
there are situations where responsibility should be taken by the victim
in this sort of situation.

Now, before anyone gets all up in arms at me, realize this: \_I hate the
idea of rape\_. It is, as far as i can tell, the only truly inexcusable
crime, and the suggestion that the victim may have borne some
responsibility is in no way intended to suggest that the rapist involved
should take less blame, or a lighter punishment. But there are a few
good points to remember in this article.

We have reached a point in the sexual environment where women are taking
control of their sexual persons. They blog about it. They party naked on
video. They \_know\_ the risks, and be damned if it's suggested that
they can't take care of themselves. And i, for one, am inclined to
agree. The average woman is not stupid - well, no more stupid than the
average man. And if someone seems to be "off" or not quite safe, any
sensible person knows to get the hell out. To quote the article linked
above: "It didn't take a Ph.D. to figure out that going alone to Tyson's
room at 2:30 a.m. was an imprudent thing to do,"

So where does this go? I mean, we live in a society where someone who
felt that she didn't get enough commitment the day after can "accuse her
partner of rape (Thanks, Dan
Savage)":http://www.thestranger.com/2001-11-29/savage.html - see the
letter from NYCG.

Now, note from the article just cited that the incident was still a
nasty one, but i agree with the conclusions drawn from it. Sometimes
situations happen - where the victimizer is in the wrong, and clearly
so, just again to be clear - where the victim needed to take a bit more
into their own hands.
