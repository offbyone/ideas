We all know how painful warranty work can be; it's never in the company's immediate economic interest to give a good goddamn about sales it's already made, and warranty work is a cost to the company.

So, it's all the more impressive when something goes right. _Really_ right. Like, "Sorry, Mr. Offby1, your part is going to take too long to ship. How about a brand new, **massive upgrade**?".

So, shipping to me next week is a [17" Macbook Pro](http://www.apple.com/ca/macbookpro/specs.html). No charge.

/me gets geeky shivers of glee.
