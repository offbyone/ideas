Well, in a relatively time I'll be on a plane headed for Japan, courtesy of much of my family's generosity.

This is as foreign to me as it gets; not only can I not speak the language, but I won't even be able to identify most symbols in print. I anticipate getting lost a few times, but it's not like this is going to be a high pressure trip.

Anyway, I'm putting off packing, which is a bad idea at this point. More to come, one hopes.
