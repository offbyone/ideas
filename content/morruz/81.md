Well, I think Simon and I escaped the jetlag even, we slept pretty well last night, and were up all day yesterday. Both of us are pretty impressed so far with Frankfurt (although I am having a hard time navigating this keyboard). It is quite a beautiful city with a very nice river valley and downtown area, which we are staying right in.

I tried Buffalo Mozzarella yesterday for lunch, as I was told it was the only way to eat mozzarella, and it was OK. Pretty much just like unripened cheese is supposed to taste, I think.

We were pretty impressed with our hotel (not hostel, like the advertisement led us to believe) so we asked to reserve for the 19th, and well, instead of costing 51€ like last night did, it will cost 189€. We declined. We just need a bed after all. So we will likely just rebook our flight for the next day, or if that's not possible stay in a surrounding town. Apparently this world cup thing is a big deal. I'll let Simon on for a while.

On a side note, it's pretty cheap to go to an internet cafe here....
