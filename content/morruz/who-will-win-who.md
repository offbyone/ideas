I had so many things to say, yet now I don't know what to say. The pressure of Chris behind me posting of the same experiences, doesn't help :)

We are here, we are acquainted, and we are comfortable. I think the hardest thing to get used to is that we are not required or expected to know what to do. It's the norm to let the experts, be it of the restaurant, or market or whatever, make the decision for you. Anyway, to the real thing:

Last night, we were tourists, and went to the Eiffel Tower. It was really windy, and the top of the tower rocks like a 1980's Singer-Songwriter. Appropriately, I was nauseous, and wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.

We were tired, and had a glass of wine, and went to bed. This morning, we visited the market, and bought La pain, and then Lapin to put on La pain. As well as cheese, and what I require in any country I visit: Strawberries. Breakfast was awesome.

Now, I have to check train schedules, and have moments to do so, so more later, my friends:)

rock on
