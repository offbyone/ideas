Weekend update:

Just got back from a place called \"Wayne\":http://www.ghosttowns.com/canada/alberta/wayne.html where somebody has managed to put together arguably the most gruelling \"disc golf\":http://members.shaw.ca/discgolf/ \"course\":http://68.151.176.137/tours/Drumheller04-JasonRatke/index.html (that last link may vanish abruptly) I\'ve ever played.

Spent the weekend camping, dodging bugs, eating like gods, and generally partying it up with Beau, Jamie, and Wayne. Not the town, the person.

And played two hard, hot rounds of pretty good golf.
