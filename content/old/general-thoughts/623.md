\### Update

Interestingly, today Bruce Schneier wrote an article about culture's [war on the unexpected](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/the_war_on_the.html) that fits really nicely with this. It illustrates the flat-out falsehood of the statement "_If you've done nothing wrong, you've got nothing to fear._"

I have a hard time reading this; I realize that it's unlikely that any of this will happen to me, but that's not because it _can't_, it's because on some level I'm already suppressed in that way. This stuff makes me sick inside.
