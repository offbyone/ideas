Well, to answer Chris' question more publicly, Cajmin tried to get it on with the Brno girl last night, and I'm suspicious it did not go as planned, but I guess we will find out soon enough....:) I know I've got a big mouth! :D

I did a bunch of shopping this morning, and I bought a shower present for a friend of mine that is getting married as soon as I get back. I've recently found out that we are not to bring presents, so I've now got this beautiful Bohemian Crystal liquor set, and no one to give it to. I'm not sure if I should keep it for myself, or if I should give it to her anyway. I guess I'll decide on the train.

I got some absolutely fantastic pictures on the bridge last night. I got to watch a lightning storm brew over the amazingly lit castle, if only I could share the visuals, but really, there is no describing it. I've got a picture of the castle lit up, but no lightning occured while I shot it. right afterwards, I got the contrasting visual of a large rat run almost across my feet to the sewer drain. :) Ah, Metropolises(ies?)

I'm going to do more shopping....:)

I had an awsome conversation over breakfast this morning with a girl who just spent 1 month in Romania. I AM SO GOING! ugh, you'd never guess how beautiful and wonderful that country is. I think it may be my next destination, and I didn't know this, but I already speak one of it's official languages. Is February too soon to travel again?
