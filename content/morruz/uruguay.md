Well, two years in a row of \*just\* Chile and Argentina was too much to take, so we had to leave these known countries and set out anew (now I know we were on another \*continent\* already this trip, but it's not actually another \*country\*). So here we are in Montevideo, Uruguay. After having achieved the unbeatable feat of swiming in three oceans in a single trip, we are feeling pleasantly worn out from a day in the sun. I was glad that the weather today wasn't the same as yesterday, though I would have gone into the water anyways, lightning and all (yesterday we sat out a wicked storm at lunch, the lovely old market building that we were sitting in was being buffeted by gales and rain was finding it's way in every corner and falling on some unfortunates). Uruguay turned out to be even cheaper than other areas in South America, both in accomodation and food. Oh, and they know how to cook steak rare... how rare (okay, enough play on the rare-rare thingy)! With all that we've seen here, it's amazing that it's almost tourist-free. The city of Montevideo is full of amazing architecture, friendly people, sandy beaches, and punchbuggies (come on! Dad and I should be black and blue by now, but we've decided to opt out of the punch part of it, to prevent an escalation into something more...)

Tomorrow we take a bus to the (supposed to be) lovely city of Colonia de Sacramento, spend one night there and then take the boat back to Buenos Aires (or Rio, if you think "outside-the-box" like Dad... wacko). Then we're on a night bus to Cordoba, begining our trek across the continent back to Santiago.

Watch out, the Wild Roses are turning towards home!
