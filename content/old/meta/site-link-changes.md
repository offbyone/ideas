I'm making what I hope will be a small change to the way that the site handles post links, instead of working with index.php and queries it'll work with files and directories on the web server.

The thing is, according to [Char](http://www.livejournal.com/users/xraystar/) this didn't work too terrifically well last time I tried it.

So, if it so happens that posting goes to hell or something like that, please e-mail me and let me know. It's working like a charm on my system, but I can't guarantee that it'll do the same on yours, and if you don't tell me, I'll never know.

Thanks.
