Here's something that I will do my damnedest to teach my child: Just because you worked hard doesn't mean you worked *well*.

> In line with Dean Hogge's observation are Professor Greenberger's test results. Nearly two-thirds of the students surveyed said that if they explained to a professor that they were trying hard, that should be taken into account in their grade.
>
> Jason Greenwood, a senior kinesiology major at the University of Maryland echoed that view.
>
> "**I think putting in a lot of effort should merit a high grade**," Mr. Greenwood said. "**What else is there really than the effort that you put in?**"
>
> "If you put in all the effort you have and get a C, what is the point?" he added. "If someone goes to every class and reads every chapter in the book and does everything the teacher asks of them and more, then they should be getting an A like their effort deserves. If your maximum effort can only be average in a teacher's mind, then something is wrong."

Mr. Greenwood, you are correct in one thing: Something *is* wrong. It's not what you think it is, but you got at least part of that right. I'd grade that thought a D.
