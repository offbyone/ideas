We're in Terchová, a small and lovely town in the Slovak mountains. Getting here was quite an adventure.

We left Krakow at 0710 on a direct train to Žilina, which promply populated itself with pre-(and a few post-)pubescent Polish children. I'm pretty sure that there's a picture of me trying to sleep on some kid's camera phone. There was one pointed at me when I opened my eyes, and there was quite a bit of giggling.

We arrived in a village on the polish side when all of a sudden the train is emptied of these kids. Breathing a sigh of relief, we assume that the rest of the trip will be quieter--however, we are quickly told by the ticket man something along the lines of us having to switch to one of four buses that are sitting outside. Apparently the trains were broken, or so we were able to gather in our fractured polish. A short twisty bus ride later, we're shunted off the bus in Zwardoń, a Polish border town where we were both told to wait for a bus that would take us to our destination, and that we should get on the train that was waiting there for us.

After that, the trip was relatively straightforward, and all affairs aside, we weren't even very late into Žilina--which I might add is a surprisingly lovely city--before we hopped a short local bus out to where we're sitting now.

Dad, you'd love it here.

Anyhow, as for Krakow, it was by far the most social part of the trip as of yet. Between meeting a Greek couple on the train, running into Tullia at the train station and spending a couple evenings visiting (and drinking!) with the (neé) Dymarz sisters and Curtis, and sharing dinner with an elderly couple from Ontario, we spent far more time in Poland with other folks. It was, all in all, quite a nice side-tour.
