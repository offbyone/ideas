And then some words about my final lab - hell, those words now... It was
EASY!

Nuff said.

Now, onto the main topic. There's some
*`discussion <http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/21787>`__* going
on about a really badly lost/thoroughly won `basketball
game <http://espn.go.com/moresports/news/2002/1121/1464158.html>`__.
Now, this game (as you'll see from the article) was a high-school
playoff game, and it was *very* poorly matched - the eventual score was
115-2. So, the uptick of this discussion, and the gist of the article
seems to be that winning by a large amount is 'unsporting'. Now, i'm not
one to support the madness of hockey dads pushing 4-yr-old Joey to be
the next Gretzky, but i do subscribe to a fairly simple philosophy of
sport.

Do Your Best.

Maybe this comes from my athletic background in solo sports - there's
not really a 'point system' in Swimming, oddly enough, though i'd love
to see how one could work :) Regardless, in my mind, there's just no
place in competitive sports for failing to do one's best. You can bet
that the losing team did their best, but from what i read, the winning
team actively *tried* not to score for huge swathes of the game. This
fricken sickens me. Are we so oversensitive (Yeah, dad - that one's for
you after sending me that mail ;) that our precious wittle kiddies can't
handle a serious loss?

If that's the case, may their deity of choice help them when the real
world walks up and walks over them. It's gonna be a rough intro to life
outside of highschool if this is the coddling they're being given now.
