We took a bus toi Valparaiso this morning and are now on the coast.  Once the clouds cleared off it´s another sunny hot day.  No real big stories, we are poking around these areas and will be heading south in the near future.  The mountains around Santiago to Valparaiso are very green compared to Peru, lots of orchards and vegetable farms.

Have a great day, moi
