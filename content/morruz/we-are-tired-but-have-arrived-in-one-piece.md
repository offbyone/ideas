Hola to all our avid readers.  I am sitting in an internet cafe in Santiago, bone-tired and sweating (i'm not sure what the temperature is here today, but upon our arrival we were told that it was +37 yesterday).  It has been a long day, and a half, I think. Our 'overnight' flight was much forshortened by the fact that 1) we lost 5 hours time-zone hopping from Vancouver to Santiago, and 2) our stop in Lima, where they have to wake everyone up, get your seat back in the upright position, trays safely stowed, and sit on the ground for over an hour while passengers get on and off.  Then we had 3 more hours in the air, during which I kinda dozed, and Dad figures he dozed almost not at all, and then we arrived.  Thankfully, customs and all associated rigamorroll (sp?) all went smoothly and quickly.  But we arrived in town at 7:30, and can't get a room until 12:30, and so after walking around a while, finding a coffee, and just now, a beer (as I mentioned the soaring temperatures), i definately find myself running out of steam, and all I can think off is getting that room and laying down for a 4 hour siesta.  Then our plan is to wander around some more this evening when it has hopefully cooled down a tad, and things are a little more lively (all the areas we walked in so far seemed to be real late risers, even for such things as coffee shops, which was surprisingly hard to find.

So yeah, more to tell later when we're rested and have all our wits about us.
