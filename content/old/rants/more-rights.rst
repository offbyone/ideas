So, as is usual around this time of day, i'm reading up on
[Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/22664 "Can
Corporations Lie?"), seeing what the latest crap is, and there's a link
to some [commentary](http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0101-07.htm
"The right to lie?") on a Nike-related court case.

An interesting quirk of US law is that, for legal purposes, corporations
are considered to be persons. They enjoy many of the same rights that
people do, and in a sense, there is a good reason for this - contract
law. Essentially, only a person can enter into a contract with another
person, so in order to enforce contracts signed by corporations beyond
the tenure of their board of directors, they have to have *some* of the
legal status of a person. However, as is pointed out too often, and
rightly so, corporations in this age enjoy many of the protections of
personhood, but experience few, if any, of the limitations.

And i quote:

| >Corporations are non-living, non-breathing, legal fictions. They feel
  no pain. They don't need clean
| >water to drink, fresh air to breathe, or healthy food to consume.
  They can live forever. They can't be
| >put in prison. They can change their identity or appearance in a day,
  change their citizenship in an
| >hour, rip off parts of themselves and create entirely new entities.
  Some have compared corporations
| >with robots, in that they are human creations that can outlive
  individual humans, performing their
| >assigned tasks forever.

It's a pretty valid critique, and one that -- i admit -- i hadn't really
given any thought to. Now i will, and it may have an impact on my
generally pro-corp stance. Not to any great extent, true, but i'll think
twice before *really* boosting them.

That is all.
