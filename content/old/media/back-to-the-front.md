Although i read it a bit less regularly than some, what with not getting the paper on a daily basis, one of the only strips that has kept my interest, through the steady decline of the modern comic page is Doonesbury. Recognizable characters, interesting plotlines, a viewpoint that differers from mine\... Scratch that last, a \_viewpoint at all\_. Well, at the start of this week, Trudeau began a [huge change](http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/dailydose/index.html?uc_full_date=20040419) to one of his longtime characters.

BD without a helmet. It\'s tough to picture, if you\'ve read the strip for as long as I have.

I\'m officially interested. As, as usual, are \"these\":http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/32610 folks.
