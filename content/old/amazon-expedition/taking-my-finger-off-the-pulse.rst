I'm an inveterate blog reader, which must come as a surprise to
precisely nobody. I read blogs by authors, programmers, and random joes
who seem to have something interesting to day. To augment that, I also
read community weblogs (Metafilter being the most prominent of that
lot).

I read these blogs... too much. I've traced this down to a desire to
always be abreast of the latest developments in the part of the world
that interests me. I don't want to miss anything. And, what ends up
happening is that I miss a lot... just nothing online. What I miss most
is being a reader of books. I rarely read books any more because, well,
where would I find the time?

To that end, I'm going to try scale back my consumption of blog content.
Specifically, MetaFilter and Slashdot -- which I don't follow much any
more. I'm not going to stop reading them, but I'm going to avoid
discussion threads, and stick to reading the articles. I'm going to pick
up more books. And hopefully I'll find the version of myself that loves
reading again. We have a nice back yard coming to us... It'd be a shame
to waste it.
