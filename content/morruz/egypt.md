So here goes, again.  
On Friday I spent 20 minutes of expensive internet time doing a post, and when I went to file it the stupid thing kicked me out and I lost the whole thing! I just hope I can remember everything now.  
Egypt was a real revelation. The Egyptian Museum was fantastic, I saw the King Tut exhibit and could have spent days there. M&D, do you remember the styrofoam model I made in grade 7? It's always fascinated me. No photos, though. We had to leave cameras behind.  
It was also the day of the big party at the Pyramids. Dinner was great, the laser light show was pretty hokey but Tom Cochrane rocked. It was surreal, 5000 year old stones in the background and rock and roll.  
The gambling has been good to both of you, S&J. I only lose when I'm playing for myself.  
This is going to be quick because Harvey is standing over my shoulder. Still no photos, I thought I had loaded some in Istanbul but now I can't find them on the site.  
I'll be home in 3 days, miss you all.
