For specifics, well, I think that the best sum-up of my relationship
with my father is the thing he said to me about living with Char and I
for half a year: It's nice that we get to experience living together as
adults and equals, and thus get to know each other better than otherwise
we would.

Happy Father's Day (one day late)
