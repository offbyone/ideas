I\'m beginning a complete re-write of the e-mail signature plugin that i was working on around a year ago. For those of you who haven\'t noticed, at the bottom of my e-mails there\'s usually a tagline that indicates what song i have currently playing in WinAMP as i write the message. I\'m hoping to fix up the plugin so that it\'s both more flexible and easier to maintain. If anyone is interested in the thing, let me know and i\'ll hook you up once it\'s done.
