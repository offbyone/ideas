In the spirit of a gigantic \[fuck you\](<http://www.athens2004.com/>) to the \[monkeys\](<http://www.athens2004.com/>) that came up with this [hyperlink policy](http://www.athens2004.com/athens2004/page/legacy?lang=en&cid=dd7e01e3ac979f00VgnVCMServer28130b0aRCRD) for the Athens games, I'd like to add my little snippet to the spew. The theme on what little Metafilter \[had to say\](<http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/35036>) was attaching profanity to links to them. I say, go wild. Please, if you run a website, link that way.

And click through, by all means :) I want them to _know_ they're getting those links!
