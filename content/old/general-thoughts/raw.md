I don't know why, but for the last few days -- say, a week or so -- i've been feeling just\... raw. Scraped thin. I don't think it's tired, per se, although that's not helping, but i feel like\...

I feel like i always do before things go bad, that's how i feel. It's a feeling of impending doom, hanging over my head, and i don't have anything i can see telling me what's coming. Life isn't perfect, but I can't see any signs that the really important things in it \-- School, Char, friends \-- are going anywhere\...

Yeah, i know\... "precognition". Feh. Pseudoscientific bullshit psychobabble. Crap. But this is a feeling I've learned to heed, because it's been right more often than it's been wrong. It's not deterministic or anything, but it makes me nervous all the same. I only hope i'm wrong and my life \-- so good until now \-- isn't going into a tailspin around me.

Wish me luck :-)
