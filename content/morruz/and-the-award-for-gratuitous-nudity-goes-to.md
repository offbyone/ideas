Char and I are sitting at the opera, enjoying the performance of Leonard Bernstein's Candide. The set design is fantastic, all sorts of moving towers and walkways, the singing is wonderful, and I'm finding that I'm enjoying the music more than I expected to. Of course, the plot is making little to no sense, but as we'll discover later, that's not our fault, really. The plot does in fact make no sense.

There's a relatively tender reunitement of Candide and Cunegonde, and on the screen behind them all of a sudden... something that looks tantalizingly like a bosom. Of course, it can't be that. This is, after all, the opera. However, the bosom is followed by nude torsos... and then more than that. Of course later on there will be topless dancers, but at the moment this is all somewhat surprising. Opera in Canada has never been this... Risque.

We go for a walk away from the tourist area. Don't get me wrong; the old city is quite lovely, but the crowds can be somewhat taxing over time. The goal is instead to see if I can find a pizza joint that dad and I had eaten at five years prior. After a lengthy walk along the river, we turn inland and amazingly enough, through a tangled warren of streets finaly set foot in front of Aldo's Pizzaria.

And yes, it is as good as last time.
