Well, it's departure day finally. No more sleeps (it's almost like waiting for Christmas). Funny, I used to get this feeling when I was first leaving home for a trip, that mixture of anticipation for something new and unknown mixed with the trepidation that something might go wrong and end up cancelling the whole thing. But now that I am a certified world traveller (not certifiable, I don't think) the departure date has gotten to be more of a relaxed thing, since I've travelled to the unknown several times and it's worked out, one way or another. But this next step really is a big one, and really is into the undiscovered territory, at least by anyone I know (including Nana and Grandad, who have been all over this small world of ours). So I get that feeling again. What will tomorrow bring? Or the day after? Ahh, I can't wait.

you'll notice a couple of new pictures, these are from the past couple days here in Ushuaia. We've had sunshine now for three days in a row, so we've been getting out of town and seeing the countryside. I got to teach a couple Israelis how to build a snowman at the base of a glacier. I don't think it shows in the picture, but even the snow has a blue tinge to it.

Bye for now!
