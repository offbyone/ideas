For the last few weeks i've been poking at the edges of a new project,
something to take the edge off of my general inability to keep track of
appointments, schedules, etc. A long time ago, i was using MS Outlook
for this, but i had to switch off of it since i started using IMAP mail
-- Outlook is great in some ways, but it's really weak in IMAP support
unless you're using the (very expensive) Exchange server.

Anyway, this having been decided, I started investigating J2EE(Java 2
Enterprise Edition) solutions. For those who don't know, J2EE is
probably the most complex server side programming system in the whole
universe. It's debatable whether even God could code in this without
losing some sleep over it.

What's my point?

After many days of pain and sturm and drang, I made my webserver talk to
a database, and tell it to do things. And what's more, i made it do this
stepping through all the hoops that J2EE so nicely tangles in a pile in
front of developers.

Yes, it's a small thing. But it's \*damned\* satisfying.
