I'll begin packing tonight; mostly the simple stuff. The cds, some of the clothes, maybe start picking out a few books and other odds and ends. As is usual for a trip like this, I'm excited and a little nervous. What am I going to forget? Honestly, as long as I don't forget something stupid like my passport, I'll be fine. Most of all, I'm really looking forward to just relaxing. Bumming around Prague for a few weeks seems like a great idea, I have to say.
