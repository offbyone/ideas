Aternately:  A touch down.

Not really, I guess, but it's interesting decompressing and realizing how much stuff I need to get done.  I freely admit, I'm procrastinating something fierce right now, trying to avoid actually workingon anything productive.  Bah.  How ... normal.

Anyway, EclipseCon was great.  I hope I'll be able to make it again next year, although I doubt it, since next year I'll be schooling full-time, and I don't expect I'll be in the same position to ask for favours from work.  Still, one never knows.
