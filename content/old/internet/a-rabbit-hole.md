If you want to while away a few hours, and find out more about one of the more unnerving \[celebrity-sponsored\](<http://gawker.com/5002269/the-cruise-indoctrination-video-scientology-tried-to-suppress>) cults out there, I recommend checking out \[Operation Clambake\](<http://www.xenu.net/>) when you have some time to spare.

What I get out of this is a low-level sense of fear that the reportage we get on the subject of scientology \-- or the lack thereof, more accurately \-- is a reflection of a more thorough penetration of the media by this _very_ media-savvy organization.

And then I accuse myself of being paranoid and move on\... but never completely without a care.

Scientology is the one and only thing that makes me _glad_ it is impossible to be elected in the US or Canada without professing to some christian belief system.

This post brought to you as a tiny, tiny shot from the Internet's side of \[Scientology vs. The Internet\]([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_vs._the_Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_vs._the_Internet)).
