I'm ready to go. Now I just have to wait. The only real apprehension I have is that I don't know what we'll do in Germany. I hear it's pretty boring and expensive in Frankfurt, so I'm cool with just drinking beers, relaxing and taking in the new scenery. Getting used to not being understood. Ugh. And taking lots of pictures.

I can't believe I'm doing this. And I can't believe it's already happening. Well, here goes!
