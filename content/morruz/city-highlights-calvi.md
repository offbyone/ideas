Well, I got a lot of pictures at different angles, of this:

I was surprised by the arid climate. If you turned your back on the Med, you could swear you were in Arizona. There were cacti, Brambles, Lizzards, Prickly pears, and it was always dry. We did a lot of beaching, snorkeling, eating, beach walking, souvenier (window) shopping, and close to home type exploring. The Dry climate was really a nice surprise: it meant that we were not suffocating, and at any moment, if we were too hot, we could just tuckin the shade and we were fine. It meant cool nights, too. Refreshing!

The week was spent in mostly relaxation mode, with only one day of bike rental, which resulted in a day at the (different beach). And the week also brought a lot of eating. May wonderful discoveries, (including that I still make better Paella) and, as Chris mentioned before, a creepy, creepy excursion to an old (prison?) (fort?) (watchtower?) It never really became clear exactly what it was other than random and creepy. Beautiful, though.
