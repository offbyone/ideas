This week has been pretty stressful all around, but in the last few days, thanks in no small part to Char, I\'ve been feeling more relaxed. We\'ve been a bit tense, but it\'s\... nicer. And I\'m feeling better about life as a whole than I have for a long while.

I\'m trying to do more work around the house, partly because Char\'s taking a class plus working full time\... well, she *was* working full time. She goes back to her sane schedule this coming week, which will mean I\'ll get to see more of her. The other reason I want to do more around the house is simple: I\'ve had it pretty good for a long time, but as long as Char\'s working to pay for our lifestyle there\'s no reason she should have to carry the housework load. I acknowledge that there\'s always going to be a gap, because there are things that I care about that she does not, and vice versa, but I\'m trying to narrow it down some.

In other news, I have a reasonable hope that I\'ll be getting jump number 22 in tomorrow, weather permitting\... which it seems not to be. Damn.

We\'ll see.
