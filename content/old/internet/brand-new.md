Well, thank _you_, Stewart Brand, for doing a fine job of saying something that I've held to be true for a good long time: [Good old stuff sucks]([http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_8.html#brand](http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_8.html#brand)).

This is part of the [EDGE questions for 2008](http://www.edge.org/questioncenter.html); "What did you change your mind about in 2007?" This is a web thing, I suppose, but some fine thinkers are involved, and their responses run the gamut from predictable (Sam Harris) to interesting (Richard Dawkins).

I recommend checking the rest of them out from the provided links. I'm on my way to work, but I think that this evening I'll try to add my own "What did I change my mind about in 2007?" to it; _if_ I can find one ;)
