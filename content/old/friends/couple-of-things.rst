Well, it's been a few days, and persuant to my resolution to post more,
here's one.

Items of note:

| - I've just bombed a [Cmput
  340](http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/courses/Cmput340.php) midterm, or at
  least I'm pretty sure I did. That course is raping my mind, it's just
  not as easy as I had hoped (given my knack for numbers) that it would
  be.
| - I'm getting up to speed in [Cmput
  391](http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/courses/Cmput391.php) now, mostly as a
  consequence of paying attention in class. I had my head up my ass at
  the beginning of the term, and I seem to have gotten it out.
| - [Char](http://xraystar.livejournal.com) and I are going to be making
  our way down to Mexico this coming week. This will slow posting down
  to a crawl, for reasons that should be obvious to anyone. It's not as
  far south as the dad and sister are (Miss you guys!) but it's a step.
  33 degree weather! Ech :). Still, since I have to bring homework with
  me, I'm not as relaxed as I could be. It'll be nice to get away,
  though.
| - New look to the site, if you didn't notice :)
| - DietFilter: [Aaron](http://www.spaz.ca/) has been raving about a
  Calorie-Reduced diet that he's on. It seems like a lot of work, but it
  also seems to be backed by real science. I have to admit, it might be
  an argument from authority, but I'm pretty curious. I wonder if I'd
  have the willpower to do it?

If anything else comes up, of course I'll post about it.
