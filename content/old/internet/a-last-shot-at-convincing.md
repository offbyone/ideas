I know I harp on this one a lot, but perhaps "this":http://isc.incidents.org/diary.php?date=2004-06-29 will scare the last few holdouts amongst you away from using Internet Explorer for anything secure, or better yet, anything at all.

As [discussed](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/29/1913222&mode=thread&tid=109&tid=113&tid=126&tid=187&tid=95) on slashdot, the gist of this is that a sneaky program (that can install itself invisibly when you view a webpage that tries to install it) can insert itself into your browser and read your secure information (that'd be _credit cards_, folks!) *before* it's encrypted.

| There _are_ alternatives, though:
| "FireFox":http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ is one, and it's the one that I use. "Opera":http://www.opera.com/ is another, although it's not really my favourite. Also, there's the old standby, "Netscape":http://www.netscape.com/ although I wouldn't recommend it personally, and Netscape's spiritual successor "Mozilla":http://www.mozilla.org/ which is basically the big brother of Firefox.

Seriously, folks. This is serious business. Don't take chances unnecessarily.
