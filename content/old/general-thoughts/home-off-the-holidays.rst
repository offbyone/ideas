I'm back in town for a bit of work now. For at least the next couple of
days I'll be working locally, which means home at night and relatively
short trips to work (for me. You don't want to ask Miranda how \_she\_
feels about it, let me tell you!)

So, the plus of this is that I'll actually have a bit of a life. The
minus is, I'll not be pulling in LOA, which means $60/day less in
income.

You win some, you lose some. Bummer.

Heh. Actually, I'm pretty happy with that. It'll be brief, but pleasant.
