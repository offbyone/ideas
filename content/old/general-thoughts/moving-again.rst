As seen over on [Char](http://xraystar.livejournal.com)'s weblog, we're
moving again.

This time, though, it's to somewhere where we'll have our own kitchen :)

I'm a little freaked by the suddenness of the move -- we'll (possibly --
it could be as late as a month from now) be moving literally the day
after tomorrow, which is... abrupt. Especially with the dearth of trucks
available to us to do the moving. Fortunately, we don't have a lot of
large furniture, but there's enough to render it ... awkward.

However, I'm happy to be about it. It'll be nice to get some space, and
the

is pretty nice, too. It's expensive, but it is downtown, which is...
convenient. Don't be fooled by the picture -- there's no stairs in our
suite, we're strictly flat :) Kickass balcony, though.

So, we'll be moving. It means no phone for a few days, if the move
happens this weekend, so we'll be hard to reach. Email, as usual,
though.

### Update

Well, it looks like moving will be delayed... one day. Monday, it is. Or
next week, sometime. However, we're approved! Yay! We have a house!
