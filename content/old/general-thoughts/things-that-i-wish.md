Okay, \_thing\_ that I wish.

I wish that my iPod was not a dead lump of metal, plastic, and silicon sitting on my desk taunting me with the space that it could be using for music that is now unavailable to me because it slipped from my hand yesterday afternoon and fell to the ground, damaging the hard drive irreparably.

So, I want a new one.

So, I count my pennies.

So, I count too few.

So, I sit here and curse.

So, I wait and wish it were a time that I could afford it.

Fuck.
