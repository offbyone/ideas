i figured I'd go through and do a highlight reel, since all you got was random mumblings of tired folk, likely just at the internet shop to kill time in waiting for something else :)

Paris:  
We started at the Eiffle tower, Wow. Big steel thing. This is a quote from my personal travel log:

*"While in the historical part of the Musee des Egouts, {sewer museum} there was a mural pained of Jean Valjean carrying Marius, like in the book, so I made Chris take a picture of me in front of it. There was a couple checking us out, since we were making silly faces, animated commentary, and getting the settings on the camera just right. Since we were paying so much attention to it, they went over, and read the plaque describing the scene. The look on their faces and the shrug they both gave each other made it clear that they just didn't get it. I got a good chuckle out of that. I know how it feels to check something out because peole around you are making a big deal out of it only to just not get it. See: Eiffle tower. Is it litterally just a tall monument whose only signigicance is it's status as a tourist attraction ?!?"*

She is quite pretty, though

The next day, of course, we checked out the sewer museum, from which the last quote came. It is arguably the only reason I'd ever gotten to step foot in Paris, so it's likely the reason that this trip was made. It was worth it. I enjoyed it, saw the first rat of my life. I'd felt one run over my foot in Prague, and saw it's tail, but that was barely the whole animal. If you squint, you can see it in this picture:

To continue on our underground theme, Chris and I visited the Catacombs. It was at one time I rock quarry, which they took too much rock out of, and the city started sinking in some parts, so they stopped mining, and since at the same time, they were having problems with the cemetaries being over full and starting to smell, they turned it into a giant undergroung ossuary. It was damp, winding, earthy, creepy and just plain wonderful.

Now, we've seen where Napolean was born, and entombed:

And where Christophe Colombe was born and entombed. (Both born in Corsica, and Nap entombed at The church of Les Invalides, and Chris entombed in Dominican Republic) Neet, I guess ;)
