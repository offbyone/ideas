[This article](http://www.techcentralstation.com/092105B.html) (Found on [/.](http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/28/0011245&tid=146&tid=218)) is an interesting comment on a problem I\'ve observed in CS, as well. Basically, although I\'ll concede that my sympathy is\... limited (is \_anyone\_ surprised by that?) on the subject, this author makes a good point. The people who make it into the teaching positions in the hard sciences are often not sociable people. I can think of one professor I had last year that acted as though he saw every conversational request for help as a prelude to me trying to make off with his lunch money. And he\'s not the worst in the school.

Fixes? Who knows\... Maybe more teachers like \[Moebius Stripper\](<http://www.talldarkandmysterious.ca/>) are needed, or maybe somebody needs to look at these professors\' skills and, if they cannot teach, \_teach them to\_.
