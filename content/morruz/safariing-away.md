Well, I am down in the SW corner of Kenya, Kericho. This is a camping safari, we set up our own tents nightly but do have a camp cook. We went from Nairobi up to Naguru then back to Lake Nakuru national park then to the Masai Mara national reserve. I've seen all types of antelope and gazelles, lions, wildbeasts, cheetahs (including on a kill), giraffes, elephants rhinos, etc. It is quite interesting and I'm having fun.  
What a basic trip, cold showers, bathrooms that barely fit our description, good food, travel in a large safari truck, what a different country.  
Tomorrow we go into Tanzania for the last week of this trip with our first night on the shore of lake victoria.  
Having a good time with our group, mostly auzzies. Did a tea plantation tour today.  
Hopefully find a better connection soon or else may not post until the 15.
