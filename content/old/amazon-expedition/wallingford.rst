I think -- and I'll know by the time many of you read this -- that we
may have found a home, at least for now. It's a compromise (we'll have
to store the dining room set, which makes me ... sad) but I think it's a
good one.

The neighbourhood is awesome. We're a 10-minute walk from shopping;
farmer's markets, groceries, and bookstores. Plus,
`BottleWorks <http://bottleworksbeerstore.blogspot.com/>`__... which is
not necessarily a *good* thing, per se; that is one hell of a beer
store.

It suffers from not being perfect; no houses really are. But, my
heavens, the location is so good. It's even right beside an urban
garden.
