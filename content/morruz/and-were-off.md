Or here, or whatever. We landed this morning, did a bit of a walkabout around the river in Frankfurt (which is surprisingly pretty. Lots of trees... um... trees...). Stopped for an espresso in one spot, a pint and a snack in another, and then back for a nap to make at least a passing attempt at catching up on the sleep I didn't get on the plane.

Now out again, possibly to grab a bottle of wine and wander around the river area. We'll see.
