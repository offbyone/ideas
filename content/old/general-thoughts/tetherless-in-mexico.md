Well, it so happens that if I sit out on our balcony in the resort, I actually piggyback the wireless connection (poorly-secured) of someone in the neighborhood. They're not very security-conscious (their router has the default password, a bad idea in general) but I'm grateful for it.

It's hot here, but friendly. The crowd is almost 100% older than \[Char\](<http://xraystar.livejournal.com/>) and I \-- mostly yuppies and retirees \-- but I'm an old man at heart, so I fit right in :)

I'm going to take it lazy. Reading is going to be the thing I do most of, I think. That, and sunburn.

Also, although this is a bit less Mexico and a bit more personal, I chipped a tooth on my tongue ring this morning at breakfast. I stopped, thought about it for a second, and then decided that this is basically the last straw. Moments later, for the first time in years, I now have _no_ body jewelery. Over the course of the day, I've realized just how much I actually fidget with it, as I have tried and failed to flick it about 6 times just today.

I don't know how I feel about it being gone, but with the rate at which the tongue heals, even now, 12 hours later, it is too late to go back.
