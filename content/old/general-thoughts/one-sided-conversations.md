Current events have, as i\'m sure all of you know, gotten very interesting on the political and world-issues front. From the scrap over in Iraq, to the shrinking civil liberties in the US, to the intense anti-americanism that penetrates our national government, to my favourite people - anti-war protestors, of course! - there\'s no end to the number of interesting things going on in the world around me.

The problem is, i don\'t feel like talking about them. At least, not the way i usually do. Why? Because i\'m missing my universal foil. Somehow, it\'s just not the same to yak about these things with even the more interesting and well-spoken/thought people in my life (To whomever is reading this: If you have ever talked with me about this, you\'re on the list).

So, i did something that i do pretty rarely the other day.. It may not have been all that much, but i attempted an apology/reconciliation with Jamie. At least, i tried one insofar as i feel i owe an apology, which only goes so far. (What\'s this about? \[This\](/backlog/2002/12/01/dot-dot-dot/)

Anyway, i sent off an e-mail that consisted, essentially, of \"Well, i think you were a prick, but i was an asshole too, so here i am, apologizing for the ways in which i was an asshole\"

Naturally, this came with the attendant verbal spew that i\'m so good at :)

Consequent to this, i got a reply that *i* read as \"Well, Chris, until you grovel before me and beg my forgiveness without qualifications, we don\'t have anything to talk about\"

Imagine my amusement.
