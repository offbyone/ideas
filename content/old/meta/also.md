Thanks to the wonderful support personnel at [EJB Solutions](http://www.ejbsolutions.com/) my server is now up and running. I\'d like to take this opportunity to state that, for the few readers of my site that are java developers, the support and service you will receive at EJB is amazing, and worth every penny i paid for it. If you need a good, solid, stable Java / J2EE toolset, check this one out.

So, in case you missed it, the whole shebang is working again. Hopefully it\'ll stay this way for a while - at least until i move the site to a new URL. I\'m investigating a domain name. Suggestions for names (check first, to see if they\'re open) are *more* than welcome.
