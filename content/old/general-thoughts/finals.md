Although it's obviously no longer the focus of this little piece of the web, I _do_ have my final grades in for my courses for this semester:

| * Psych 258: B- (the lowest grade)
| * Math 225: A- (the next lowest)
| * Cmpt 204: A
| * Cmpt 291: A
| * Stat 222: A (the one of which I am most proud, given that it was my lowest mark last semester)

So there are the results.

My GPA for the last two years is 3.617 which is respectable, if only just barely an A- overall average. Still needs work, but the worst (ENGL101) is past. All that i have left to worry about is the progress of my **goddamed registration at U of A**!!!
