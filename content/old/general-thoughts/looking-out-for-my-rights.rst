After reading about some disturbing events in the US detailing the
arrest and mistreatment of citizens whose only apparent crime was the
recording of police activity (see
`here <http://www.nbc10.com/news/9574663/detail.html>`__, with
discussion
`here <http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/07/30/0557216>`__, and
`here <http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060629/NEWS01/106290121>`__,
with discussion
`here <http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/06/29/188221&tid=172>`__),
I'm interested in looking out for my \_own\_ rights in that respect, as
a Canadian citizen.

I've realized that much of what I expect to be true in my interactions
with the Police is informed by my consumption of US media, where, for
example, there \_are\_ property rights enshrined in the constitution,
and the 4th amendment exists. Here in Canada, neither of those things
are true.

I'm not so much interested in what the practical rights are, but rather
what my \_legal\_ rights are.

I've contacted the `CCLA <http://www.ccla.org/>`__ (Canadian Civil
Liberties Association) on the subject, and will be posting this to Ask
MetaFilter later this evening (**Update:** Did so, it's `at the other
end of this link <http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/43315>`__), so follow
along as I try to find out what my rights are.

Maybe I'll get lucky, and actually learn something.
