Ahh, politics.  I love the smell of\...

Shit.

It would appear, from the news at least, that [checking a voting machine can result in a \$40,000 \"repair\" charge](http://www.sltrib.com/ci_3646075) regardless of any actual damage to the machine itself.

There\'s a trend in the modern electoral machine in the Unites States towards greater automation.  What there is not is a trend towards correspondingly greater accountability.  He who counts the votes, &c.

I just find myself wishing that there would be some sense of actual interest on the part of the public at large, but what there is, instead, is a whole big steaming pile of apathy.  Hell,it\'s contagious \-- I had a hard time motivating myself to rant about it, and I can tell from the pace of the text above that I\'m really just phoning it in.

So what\'s the solution?
