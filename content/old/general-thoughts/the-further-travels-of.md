Wedding is now done\...

Wow. Okay, it wasn't exactly rocket science, but there was a fair amount of work and responsibility involved in getting that wedding to go off smoothly for Beau and Sarah. At some point, when i have them in a digital form, i'll have to post some pics\... (Since you asked so nicely, John\...)

Other than that, well, the week has gone nicely. I've had a nice time traveling with Char, stresses and strains notwithstanding. We've now reached the last of our modes of transporation for the trip, having added limousine to the list, and i am now awaiting boarding for Westjet flight 37 to Edmonton. You wanna know what's neato? Wireless internet. I'm typing this on my laptop, in the boarding gate, on the vancouver aiport's free wireless internet connection. This makes me deeply happy :)

| So, about the wedding:
| The whole setting was just amazing; Sarah's parents' house is set overlooking the ocean with tons of trees, big windows, and nice beaches\... Just gorgeous. For those who've never seen it (all of you?) i was actually in a tuxedo, looking dashing all the way\...

oh\... gotta run\.... boarding the plane. more later\...
