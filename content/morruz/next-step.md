OK, I am down some back street in Luxor and found an internet. We got on the boat, a quite upper class boat trip but really relaxing. Heat, we have had some quite hot days, nights are cool.  
Aswan was a beautiful city, morris think of the Valencia and sister city thrown together. Wow you should experience the aggresive street sellers here, I mean aggressive but you can get through them. Market street in Aswan was a zoo, I must be Hogan by now in fact. By the way, peas soaked in a pepper brine go well with beer. Try Arabic web sites with arabic writing someimte.  
Abdul, our leader is fantastic. Other guides have also been good.  
OK, temples, some are fantastic but I'm getting a little templed out. The Amon Ra here at Luxor is wow awesome though, best so far with the previous being Ramses II as mentioned.  
Nubian village at Aswan was an experience as was wandering back streets here in Luxor. I did do a camel ride, try it sometime, different. Most of these will require better explanations when I get home. By the way, do not ever plan this trip in summer as it is busy now, can you imagine the crowds at busy time. Also, walking a temple at 45???
