As per the previous entry, there are some Stylesheet glitches with the
site. So, here's the deal. If you think the site looks like shit, get a
good browser. `IE6 <http://microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp>`__ and
`Mozilla <http://www.mozilla.org>`__ (and, by extension, `Netscape
6+ <http://www.netscape.com/>`__) will render the site just fine. Opera
and earlier versions of the big two browsers don't. So, since i'm both
A) lazy and B) sick and tired of beating my head on poor CSS
implementations, there will be no more changes to the stylesheet for
purposes of browser support. Thank you for your attention.
