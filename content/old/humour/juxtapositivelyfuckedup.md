Just a brief aside\... having seen this twice now (Both with the same company) I can [not]{#not}\_ get over the bizarre juxtaposition between the cutesy CGI-ish ferret creatures and the [movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_for_a_Dream) for which this song was [written](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Mansell).
