It's something I've dreamed of my whole life. It's something I may yet
see in my life, and it's something for which I would sell anything, give
anything to see. The passion with which these men speak of the moon, the
look in their eyes as they remember the experience of landing, walking
on, and -- in the end -- successfully leaving the moon behind is
something I empathize with, even if I can't _know_ the whole truth of
it.
