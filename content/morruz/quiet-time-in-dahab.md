So, yesterday was a waste day in Dahab, a resort town on the gulf of Aqaba.

<wpg2>6118</wpg2>

Just walked around, drank beer (except for the place that wasn't open because he wasn't awake yet).  
Our group is hanging out together quite well, we ususally do meals together. The food is not extraordinary but good, here there is a lot of sea food. You order by weight before it is cleaned.  
Dahab must be a divers/snorkel center as there is a lot of it here. The coast goes out about 30m shallow, 0.6m, then drops right off and those that have snorkeled say there are lots of fish and coral to be seen.  
Today on to Cairo and split off this group to head for Alexandria tomorrow. Take care all.
