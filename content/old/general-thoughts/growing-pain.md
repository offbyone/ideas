As some of you probably know, for the last couple of years my right wrist has been getting more and more sore and strained. This isn\'t really a surprise to me, since [carpal tunnel syndrome](http://www.ctsplace.com/) is basically a known side effect of spending as much time as i do at the computer.

The thing is, now that i\'m actually taking steps down a path towards a *career* in computing, i have to do something about it, because the condition is only getting worse as time goes by, not better.

So, at the [recommendation](http://www.arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/smartglove/smartglove-1.html) of one of the premier tech sites on the net, and at ridiculous personal expense, i purchased a pair of \"\`smart gloves \<http://www.imakproducts.com/products/smart_glove.htm\>\`\_\_\" to see if they could help. The gloves arrived just yesterday, so it\'s too early to tell how well they\'re gonna work, but here\'s hoping i see a difference.

I\'d like to be able to use my hands in the future\... Ya know, they\'re kind of useful :)
