Christ, do I feel like an old man this morning.

My shoulder is sore and my hip hurts. I'm sitting on the couch because, damn it, I _deserve_ some relaxation at this point.

To top it off, well... Okay, I've got nothing to top it off. I read the news this morning and it contained neither inspiration nor indignation for me, which suggests that I'm just really, really tired :)
