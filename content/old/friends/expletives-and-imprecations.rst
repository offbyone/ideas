After many, many hours of work, the move is finished.

Mostly, it just sucked. However, as I have had occasion to say to a few
people in the last few days, if you can judge a person by the calibre of
their friends, [Char](http://xraystar.livejournal.com) and I must be
pretty good people.

Much thanks to all those that helped, but extra thanks to
[Simon](http://vernondalhart.livejournal.com). without whom this move
would probably have gone much longer, much harder, and much more
unpleasantly. Of all those that helped, he put in the most time and the
most steady effort. Thanks, bro!
